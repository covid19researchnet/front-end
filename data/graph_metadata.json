The feasibility study was due to open to recruitment during the COVID-19 2020-2021 pandemic, 1Â month into the first UK-wide lockdown. We worked rapidly to implement adaptions to the trial procedures and intervention delivery that we believe are applicable to randomised controlled trials. Recruitment became predominantly via self-referral. Electronic consent was employed, with consent discussions occurring over the telephone. Registration, consent, eligibility assessment and data collection as well as the intervention (online physical activity tool) were via a secure, encrypted multi-user web-based platform for participants, physiotherapists and researchers accessible via various hardware. Physiotherapy consultations, as well as the process evaluation, were conducted remotely using video conferencing software or the telephone. A remote training package for physiotherapists and site initiations was also developed and electronic site files employed.

Survey results indicated that HPR-PPE enabled high-fidelity practice of PPE application and removal, aided procedure recall, improved user confidence and was sufficiently similar to medical-grade PPE.

The high resistance in the pulmonary circulation, as a result of small vessel thrombosis and hypoxemia, is the major cause of right heart failure associated with a particularly high mortality in severe COVID-19. Timely identification of patients at high risk for RV failure, optimization of mechanical ventilation to limit its adverse effects on RV preload and afterload, avoidance of medication-related increase in the pulmonary vascular resistance, and the use of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation in refractory respiratory failure with hemodynamic instability, before RV failure develops, can improve patient survival. Since it was confirmed that the right-sided heart is particularly involved in the clinical deterioration of patients with COVID-19 and pressure overload-induced RV dysfunction plays a key role for patient outcome, transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) received increasing attention. Limited TTE focused on the right heart appears highly useful in hospitalized COVID-19 patients and particularly beneficial for monitoring of critically ill patients. In addition to detection of right-sided heart dilation and RV dysfunction, it enables assessment of RV-pulmonary arterial coupling and evaluation of RV adaptability to pressure loading which facilitate useful prognostic statements to be made.

The chromatographic analyses enabled the identification of 40 analytes related to the presence of polymers in seawater, water traffic, and tourists habits. In Italy, on the 10th March 2020, the lockdown restrictions were enforced to control the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 infection; the ordinary urban water traffic around Venice came to a halt, and the ever-growing presence of tourists suddenly ceased. This situation provided a unique opportunity to analyze the environmental effects of restrictions on VOCs load in the Lagoon. 17 contaminants became not detectable after the lockdown period. The statistical analysis indicated that the amounts of many other contaminants significantly dropped. The presence of 9 analytes was not statistically influenced by the lockdown restrictions, probably because of their stronger persistence or continuous input in the environment from diverse sources.

Although coronaviruses typically infect the upper or lower respiratory tract, the virus RNA can be detected in plasma. The risk of transmitting coronavirus via transfusion of blood products remains. As more asymptomatic infections are identified in COVID-19 cases, blood safety has become particularly important. Methylene blue (MB) photochemical technology has been proven to inactivate lipid-enveloped viruses with high efficiency and safety. The present study aimed to investigate the SARS-CoV-2 inactivation effects of MB in plasma.The SARS-CoV-2 virus strain was isolated from Zhejiang University. The live virus was harvested from cultured VERO-E6 cells, and mixed with MB in plasma. The MB final concentrations were 0, 1, 2, and 4âÎ¼M. The \"BX-1 AIDS treatment instrument\" was used at room temperature, the illumination adjusted to 55,000âÂ±â0.5 million Lux, and the plasma was irradiated for 0, 2, 5, 10, 20, and 40âmins using light at a single wavelength of 630ânm.

MATERIAL AND METHODS We conducted an epidemiological investigation enrolling 631 patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 from our clinic from January to March 2020. Patients' information was collected through a standard questionnaire. Then, we described the patients' epidemiological characteristics, analyzed risk factors associated with disease severity, and assessed causes of zero mortality. Additionally, some key technologies for epidemic prevention and control were identified. RESULTS Of the 631 patients, 8.46% (n=53) were severe cases, and no deaths were recorded (n=0). The epidemic of COVID-19 has gone through 4 stages: a sporadic phase, an exponential growth phase, a peak plateau phase, and a declining phase. The proportion of severe cases was significantly different among the 4 stages and 13 municipal prefectures (P<0.001). Factors including age >65 years old, underlying medical conditions, highest fever >39.0Â°C, dyspnea, and lymphocytopenia (<1.0Ã10â¹/L) were early warning signs of disease severity (P<0.05). In contrast, earlier clinic visits were associated with better patient outcomes (P=0.029). Further, the viral load was a potentially useful marker associated with COVID-19 infection severity. CONCLUSIONS The study findings from the beginning of the COVID-19 epidemic in Jiangsu Province, China showed that patients who were more than 65 years of age and with comorbidities and presented with a fever of more than 39.0Â°C developed more severe disease.

Hospitalisation and clinical data were collected from medical records. A list of post-COVID symptoms with attention to musculoskeletal pain was evaluated. Anxiety and depressive symptoms, and sleep quality were likewise assessed. From a total 1,200 hospitalised COVID-19 patients, 369 with and 369 without myalgia at hospital admission were assessed 7.2 months (SD 0.6) after hospital discharge. A greater proportion (P=0.03) of patients with myalgia at hospital admission (20%) showed â¥3 post-COVID symptoms when compared with individuals without myalgia (13%). A higher proportion of patients presenting myalgia (OR1.41, 95%CI 1.04-1.90) exhibited musculoskeletal post-COVID pain when compared to those without myalgia. The prevalence of musculoskeletal post-COVID pain in the total sample was 38%. Fifty percent of individuals with pre-existing musculoskeletal pain experienced a worsening of their symptoms after COVID-19. No differences in fatigue, dyspnoea, anxiety/depressive levels or sleep quality were observed between myalgia and non-myalgia groups. The presence of myalgia at hospital admission was associated with pre-existing history of musculoskeletal pain (OR1.62, 95%CI 1.10-2.40). In conclusion, myalgia at the acute phase was associated with musculoskeletal pain as long-term post-COVID sequelae. Additionally, half of patients with pre-existing pain conditions experienced a persistent exacerbation of their previous syndromes.", "preprint": false}, "145226": {"doi": "10.1016/j.socscimed.2021.113928", "journal": "Social science & medicine (1982)", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33865093/", "date": "2021-04-18", "title": "COVID-19 information on social media and preventive behaviors: Managing the pandemic through personal responsibility.", "subfield": "Mental Health", "authors": "Piper Liping L", "abstract": "In the face of a pandemic, social media have found to be vital information channels that might exert a positive influence on people's preventive behaviors.

A sample of 511 online participants (mean ageÂ =Â 32.47 years) responded to anonymous questionnaires regarding COVID-19 information consumption on social media, health orientation, personal responsibility, and preventive behaviors. Bias-corrected bootstrap method was used to test the moderated mediation model. Results indicated that after controlling for participants' age, gender, education, income, and insurance, personal responsibility mediated the relationship between COVID-19 information consumption on social media and preventive behaviors. Meanwhile, the direct relation between COVID-19 information consumption on social media and preventive behaviors, and the mediation effect of personal responsibility were moderated by health orientation.

Literature on the impact on individuals with eating disorders is slowly emerging.

For children and adolescents, weak recommendations were supported for telehealth family-based treatment (FBT) and online guided parental self-help FBT.

Weak recommendations for emerging adults included CBT-based group internet interventions as treatment adjuncts, internet-based relapse prevention Maudsley Model of Anorexia Nervosa Treatment for Adults (MANTRA) guided self-help, telehealth relapse prevention using MANTRA, and guided CBT-based smartphone apps as treatment adjuncts. For caregivers of children and adolescents, weak recommendations were supported for virtual parent meal support training, and moderated online caregiver forums and support groups. For caregivers of emerging adults, guided parental self-help CBT was strongly recommended, and unguided caregiver psychoeducation self-help was weakly recommended.Several gaps for future work were identified including the impact of sex, gender, race, and socioeconomic status on virtual care among children, adolescents, and emerging adults with eating disorders, as well as research on more intensive services, such as virtual day hospitals.", "preprint": false}, "145183": {"doi": "10.1016/j.diagmicrobio.2021.115365", "journal": "Diagnostic microbiology and infectious disease", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33865070/", "date": "2021-04-18", "title": "Plasma as an alternative COVID-19 diagnostic specimen in a hospitalized patient negative for SARS-CoV-2 by nasopharyngeal swab.", "subfield": "Testing", "authors": "Lauren Lawrence, Bryan A Stevens, Malaya K Sahoo, ChunHong Huang, Fumiko Yamamoto, Katharina RÃ¶ltgen, Oliver Wirz, James Zehnder, Run-Zhang Shi, Scott D Boyd, Gary Schoolnik, Benjamin A Pinsky, Catherine A Hog", "abstract": "We present the case of an inpatient with pneumonia and repeatedly negative nasopharyngeal SARS-CoV-2 testing.

The aim of the present study was to determine the effect of age on the association between diabetes and mortality in patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 in Mexico. This retrospective cohort study involved patients aged 20Â years or older with symptoms of viral respiratory disease who were screened for SARS-CoV-2 infection across the System of Epidemiological Surveillance of Viral Respiratory Disease in Mexico from January 1 through November 4, 2020. Cox proportional-hazard regression was used to calculate the hazard ratio for 28-day mortality and its 95% confidence interval (CI). Among 757,210 patients with COVID-19 (outpatients and inpatients), 120,476 (16%) had diabetes and 80,616 died. Among 878,840 patients without COVID-19 (those who tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 infection), 88,235 (10.0%) had diabetes and 20,134 died.

The strength of the association decreased with age (trend test: Pâ=â0.004). For example, the adjusted hazard ratio for death was 3.12 (95% CI 2.86-3.40) for patients 20-39Â years of age; in contrast, the adjusted hazard ratio of death for patients 80Â years of age or older was 1.11 (95% CI 1.06-1.16). The adjusted hazard ratios were 1.66 (95% CI 1.58-1.74) in outpatients and 1.14 (95% CI 1.12-1.16) in inpatients. In hospitalized patients 80Â years of age or older, no association was observed between diabetes and COVID-19-related mortality (adjusted hazard ratio: 1.03; 95% CI 0.98-1.08). Among patients without COVID-19, the adjusted hazard ratio for death was 1.78 (95% CI 1.73-1.84).

We aimed to investigate the extent to which healthcare professionals have been psychologically affected by COVID-19 and related factors.Data obtained through questionnaires completed by 348 healthcare professionals working during the COVID-19 pandemic and 350 participants who are in control group were investigated. The Impact of Event Scale-revised (IES-R) for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and the Severity Index (ISI) for insomnia were used.

We interviewed participants from April to June 2020 by telephone or email. We collected and analyzed data in an iterative manner and reached theme saturation. Our team reached consensus on the major themes and subthemes.We interviewed 1 MAiD coordinator and 15 providers, including 14 physicians and 1 nurse practitioner. We identified 4 main themes. The most important theme was the perception that the pandemic increased the suffering of patients receiving MAiD by isolating them from loved ones and reducing available services. Providers were distressed by the difficulty of establishing rapport and closeness at the end of life, given the requirements for physical distancing and personal protective equipment. They were concerned about the spread of SARS-CoV-2, and found it difficult to enforce rules about distancing and the number of people present. Logistics and access to MAiD became more difficult because of the new restrictions, but there were many adaptations to solve these problems.Providers and coordinators had many challenges in providing MAiD during the COVID-19 pandemic, including their perception that the suffering of their patients increased.

The key to understanding SARS-CoV-2's higher infectivity lies partly in its host receptor recognition mechanism. Experiments show that the human ACE2 (angiotensin converting enzyme 2) protein, which serves as the primary receptor for both CoVs, binds to the receptor binding domain (RBD) of CoV-2's spike protein stronger than SARS-CoV's spike RBD. The molecular basis for this difference in binding affinity, however, remains unexplained from X-ray structures. To go beyond insights gained from X-ray structures and investigate the role of thermal fluctuations in structure, we employ all-atom molecular dynamics simulations. Microseconds-long simulations reveal that while CoV and CoV-2 spike-ACE2 interfaces have similar conformational binding modes, CoV-2 spike interacts with ACE2 via a larger combinatorics of polar contacts, and on average, makes 45% more polar contacts. Correlation analysis and thermodynamic calculations indicate that these differences in the density and dynamics of polar contacts arise from differences in spatial arrangements of interfacial residues, and dynamical coupling between interfacial and non-interfacial residues. These results recommend that ongoing efforts to design spike-ACE2 peptide blockers will benefit from incorporating dynamical information as well as allosteric coupling effects.

Till now, there is no drug molecule that has been convincingly identified as the inhibitor of the function of this protein. The current pandemic situation demands a shortcut to quickly reach to a lead compound or a drug, which may not be the best but might serve as an interim solution at least. Following this notion, the present investigation uses virtual screening to find aÂ molecule which is alraedy approved as a drug for some otherÂ disease butÂ could be repurposed to inhibit Mpro. The potential of the presentÂ methodÂ of work to identify such a molecule, which otherwise would have been missed out, lies in the fact that instead of just using the crystallographically identified conformation of the receptor's ligandÂ binding pocket, molecular dynamicsÂ generated ensemble of conformations has been used. It implicitly included the possibilities of \"induced-fit\" and/or \"population shift\" mechanisms of ligand fitting.

To gain insight into the molecular-level underpinnings of these characteristics, we used microsecond all-atom simulations. We show that changes in the protein energetics favor a higher population of infection-capable states in the G-form through release of asymmetry present in the D-form inter-protomer interactions. Thus, the increased infectivity of the G-form is likely due to a higher rate of profitable binding encounters with the host receptor.

In this study, we conduct a scenario analysis for COVID-19 in Malaysia using a simple universality class of the SIR system and extensions thereof (i.e., the inclusion of temporary immunity through the reinfection problems and limited medical resources scenarios leads to the SIRS-type model). This system has been employed in order to provide further insights on the long-term outcomes of COVID-19 pandemic. As a case study, the COVID-19 transmission dynamics are investigated using daily confirmed cases in Malaysia, where some of the epidemiological parameters of this system are estimated based on the fitting of the model to real COVID-19 data released by the Ministry of Health Malaysia (MOH). We observe that this model is able to mimic the trend of infection trajectories of COVID-19 pandemic in Malaysia and it is possible for transmission dynamics to be influenced by the reinfection force and limited medical resources problems. A rebound effect in transmission could occur after several years and this situation depends on the intensity of reinfection force. Our analysis also depicts the existence of a critical value in reinfection threshold beyond which the infection dynamics persist and the COVID-19 outbreaks are rather hard to eradicate.

To analyze the relation among COVID-19, population density, and climate, a theoretical path diagram was hypothesized and tested using structural equation modeling (SEM), a powerful statistical technique for the evaluation of causal assumptions. The results of the analysis showed that both climate and population density significantly influence the spread of COVID-19 (pâ<â0.001 and pâ<â0.01, respectively).

Other viruses in the same phylogenetic group have been responsible for previous regional outbreaks, including SARS and MERS. SARS-CoV-2 has a zoonotic origin, similar to the causative viruses of these previous outbreaks. The repetitive introduction of animal viruses into human populations resulting in disease outbreaks suggests that similar future epidemics are inevitable. Therefore, understanding the molecular origin and ongoing evolution of SARS-CoV-2 will provide critical insights for preparing for and preventing future outbreaks. A key feature of SARS-CoV-2 is its propensity for genetic recombination across host species boundaries. Consequently, the genome of SARS-CoV-2 harbors signatures of multiple recombination events, likely encompassing multiple species and broad geographic regions. Other regions of the SARS-CoV-2 genome show the impact of purifying selection. The spike (S) protein of SARS-CoV-2, which enables the virus to enter host cells, exhibits signatures of both purifying selection and ancestral recombination events, leading to an effective S protein capable of infecting human and many other mammalian cells.

Concerns have been expressed that, at their most extreme, these consequences could manifest as increased suicide rates. We aimed to assess the early effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on suicide rates around the world.We sourced real-time suicide data from countries or areas within countries through a systematic internet search and recourse to our networks and the published literature. Between Sept 1 and Nov 1, 2020, we searched the official websites of these countries' ministries of health, police agencies, and government-run statistics agencies or equivalents, using the translated search terms \"suicide\" and \"cause of death\", before broadening the search in an attempt to identify data through other public sources. Data were included from a given country or area if they came from an official government source and were available at a monthly level from at least Jan 1, 2019, to July 31, 2020. Our internet searches were restricted to countries with more than 3 million residents for pragmatic reasons, but we relaxed this rule for countries identified through the literature and our networks. Areas within countries could also be included with populations of less than 3 million. We used an interrupted time-series analysis to model the trend in monthly suicides before COVID-19 (from at least Jan 1, 2019, to March 31, 2020) in each country or area within a country, comparing the expected number of suicides derived from the model with the observed number of suicides in the early months of the pandemic (from April 1 to July 31, 2020, in the primary analysis).We sourced data from 21 countries (16 high-income and five upper-middle-income countries), including whole-country data in ten countries and data for various areas in 11 countries). Rate ratios (RRs) and 95% CIs based on the observed versus expected numbers of suicides showed no evidence of a significant increase in risk of suicide since the pandemic began in any country or area. There was statistical evidence of a decrease in suicide compared with the expected number in 12 countries or areas: New South Wales, Australia (RR 0Â·81 [95% CI 0Â·72-0Â·91]); Alberta, Canada (0Â·80 [0Â·68-0Â·93]); British Columbia, Canada (0Â·76 [0Â·66-0Â·87]); Chile (0Â·85 [0Â·78-0Â·94]); Leipzig, Germany (0Â·49 [0Â·32-0Â·74]); Japan (0Â·94 [0Â·91-0Â·96]); New Zealand (0Â·79 [0Â·68-0Â·91]); South Korea (0Â·94 [0Â·92-0Â·97]); California, USA (0Â·90 [0Â·85-0Â·95]); Illinois (Cook County), USA (0Â·79 [0Â·67-0Â·93]); Texas (four counties), USA (0Â·82 [0Â·68-0Â·98]); and Ecuador (0Â·74 [0Â·67-0Â·82]).This is the first study to examine suicides occurring in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic in multiple countries.

We used a validated questionnaire by Braithwaite and Westbrook (2004). Drawing on Palmer et al. (2007), we added a section about the characteristics of department heads.

The return rate was 47.4% for doctors and 31.6% for nurses.Doctors reported an increase in clinical governance, interdisciplinarity collaboration, and standardization of clinical work. Hybridization of practices was noted to have taken place. While doctors did not see these changes as a threat to professional values, they felt that hospital managers had taken greater control. There was a large overlap of attitudes between doctors and nurses: inter-professional integration in CDs fostered alignment of values and aims. The polarity index was higher for responses from the doctors than from the nurses.The study findings have implications for policy makers and managers: mission and strategic mandate of CDs; governance of CDs, leadership issues; opportunities for engaging healthcare professionals; changes in managerial involvement during the COVID-19 pandemic.

We evaluated concentrations of CO2 under various PPE.In a prospective observational study on healthy volunteers, CO2 levels were measured during regular breathing while donning 1) no mask, 2) JustAirÂ® powered air purifying respirator (PAPR), 3) KN95 respirator, and 4) valved-respirator. Serial CO2 measurements were taken with a nasal canula at a frequency of 1-Hz for 15-min for each PPE configuration to evaluate whether National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) limits were breached.The study included 11 healthy volunteers, median age 32âyears (range 16-54) and 6 (55%) men.

Use of face masks (KN95 and valved-respirator) resulted in significant increases in CO2 concentrations, which exceeded the 8-h NIOSH exposure threshold limit value-weighted average (TLV-TWA). However, the increases in CO2 concentrations did not breach short-term (15-min) limits. Importantly, these levels were considerably lower than the long-term (8-h) NIOSH limits during donning JustAirÂ® PAPR.

However, whether increase in CO2 levels are clinically significant remains debatable.Although, significant increase in CO2 concentrations are noted with routinely used face-masks, the levels still remain within the NIOSH limits for short-term use. Therefore, there should not be a concern in their regular day-to-day use for healthcare providers. The clinical implications of elevated CO2 levels with long-term use of face masks needs further studies. Use of PAPR prevents relative hypercapnoea.

Furthermore, we found that, compared to females, males with COVID-19, although not significantly, had higher values of inflammatory markers such as C-reactive protein (CRP) and ESR. Conversely, we found that COVID-19 positive females were older than males and required more days of hospitalization. Both males and females COVID-19 positives had procalcitonin values within the normal range and D-Dimer values slightly higher than the normal range. With regard to this latter marker, the value measured in females, although not significant, was higher than that measured in males.

virus is a zoonotic virus that is closely associated with live poultry markets. It has caused infections in humans in China since 2013. Five waves of the H7N9 influenza epidemic occurred in China between March 2013 and September 2017. H7N9 with low-pathogenicity dominated in the first four waves, whereas highly pathogenic H7N9 influenza emerged in poultry and spread to humans during the fifth wave, causing wide concern. Specialists and officials from China and other countries responded quickly, controlled the epidemic well thus far, and characterized the virus by using new technologies and surveillance tools that were made possible by their preparedness efforts. Here, we review the characteristics of the H7N9 viruses that were identified while controlling the spread of the disease. It was summarized and discussed from the perspectives of molecular epidemiology, clinical features, virulence and pathogenesis, receptor binding, T-cell responses, monoclonal antibody development, vaccine development, and disease burden.

Although it has been suggested that these drugs might lead to aÂ higher susceptibility and severity of COVID-19 infection, experimental data suggest these agents may reduce acute lung injury via blocking angiotensin-II-mediated pulmonary permeability, inflammation and fibrosis.AÂ systematic literature search was performed to answer the question: What is the effect of medications that influence ACE2 expression (ACE inhibitors (ACEIs), angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and thiazolidinediones) on the outcomes of COVID-19? Relevant outcome measures were mortality (crucial), hospital admission, length of stay, thromboembolic complications (pulmonary embolism, stroke, transient ischaemic attack), need for mechanical ventilation, acute kidney injury and use of renal replacement therapy. Medline and Embase databases were searched with relevant search terms until 24Â June 2020. After systematic analysis, nine studies were included.The results were described for two different groups, an overall group in which all users were compared with non-users and aÂ group in which only hypertensive patients were included. Within each group aÂ distinction was made between results for ACEI/ARB use, ACEI use, ARB use, NSAID use and thiazolidinedione use. None of the studies demonstrated increased mortality in the two groups. Furthermore, none of the studies showed an effect on other outcome measures in COVID-19, such as ICU admission, length of hospital stay, thromboembolic complications, need for mechanical ventilation, acute kidney failure or need for renal replacement therapy. However, the level of evidence of all studies varied from 'moderate' to 'very low', according to the GRADE methodology.Analysis of the literature demonstrated that there was insufficient evidence to answer our objective on the effect of ACE2 expression mediating pharmacotherapy on outcome in COVID-19Â patients, especially due to the low scientific quality of the described studies.

'Lockdowns' and restrictive measures, especially, have complicated service provision and access, and disrupted key supply chains. Such interventions, alongside more traditional public health measures, interact with baseline health, health system, and social and economic vulnerabilities in LMICs to compound negative impacts. This analysis, based on a rapid evidence assessment by the Social Science in Humanitarian Action Platform in mid-2020, highlights the drivers and evidence of these impacts, emphasises the additional vulnerabilities experienced by marginalised social groups, and provides insight for governments, agencies, organisations and communities to implement more proportionate, appropriate, comprehensive and socially just responses that address COVID-19 in the context of and alongside other disease burdens. In the short term, there is an urgent need to monitor and mitigate impacts of pandemic responses on health service provision, access and use, including through embedding COVID-19 response within integrated health systems approaches. These efforts should also feed into longer-term strategies to strengthen health systems, expand universal healthcare coverage and attend to the social determinants of health-commitments, both existing and new-which governments, donors and international agencies must make and be held accountable to.

In this study, the effects of a recombinant SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein S1 was investigated in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). Stimulation of PBMCs with spike glycoprotein S1 (100 ng/mL) resulted in significant elevation in the production of TNFÎ±, IL-6, IL-1Î² and IL-8. However, pre-treatment with dexamethasone (100 nM) caused significant reduction in the release of these cytokines. Further experiments revealed that S1 stimulation of PBMCs increased phosphorylation of NF-ÎºB p65 and IÎºBÎ±, and IÎºBÎ± degradation. DNA binding of NF-ÎºB p65 was also significantly increased following stimulation with spike glycoprotein S1. Treatment of PBMCs with dexamethasone (100 nM) or BAY11-7082 (1 Î¼M) resulted in inhibition of spike glycoprotein S1-induced NF-ÎºB activation. Activation of p38 MAPK by S1 was blocked in the presence of dexamethasone and SKF 86002. CRID3, but not dexamethasone pre-treatment, produced significant inhibition of S1-induced activation of NLRP3/caspase-1. Further experiments revealed that S1-induced increase in the production of TNFÎ±, IL-6, IL-1Î² and IL-8 was reduced in the presence of BAY11-7082 and SKF 86002, while CRID3 pre-treatment resulted in the reduction of IL-1Î² production. These results suggest that SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein S1 stimulated PBMCs to release pro-inflammatory cytokines through mechanisms involving activation of NF-ÎºB, p38 MAPK and NLRP3 inflammasome.

Higher resilience was associated with greater use of adaptive coping behaviors and less use of maladaptive coping behaviors. The use of maladaptive coping strategies was associated with more stress. Moreover, hierarchical regression analyses revealed that resilience was the strongest unique predictor of stress, thus, largely accounting for the observed coping-outcome associations. Individual differences in resilience levels moderated the effects of two coping strategies (planning and self-blame) on stress. Specifically, planning was associated with increased levels of stress for people with low resilience. In contrast, high personal resilience attenuated the negative effect of self-blame on their stress levels.

In this context, we investigated the effect that these personal protection habits can have in preventing new waves of contagion.We extended an agent-based COVID-19 epidemic model in a simulated community to incorporate the mechanisms of these aforementioned personal care habits and measure their incidence in person-to-person transmission. A full factorial experiment design was performed to illustrate the extent to which the interplay between these personal habits is effective in mitigating the spread of disease. A global sensitivity analysis was performed on the parameters that control these habits to further validate the results.We found that observing physical distance is the dominant habit in reducing disease transmission, although adopting either or both of the other two habits is necessary to some extent to suppress a new outbreak entirely. When physical distance is not observed, adherence to the use of masks or handwashing has a significant decrease in infections and mortality, but the epidemic still unfolds.

However, there are important issues to consider such as the fact that most ORs do not use an algorithm or guideline for protective practices and that almost half of ORNs had not received training on protection against COVID-19.", "preprint": false}, "144697": {"doi": "10.1016/j.ijporl.2021.110700", "journal": "International journal of pediatric otorhinolaryngology", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33862334/", "date": "2021-04-17", "title": "Speech pathology telepractice intervention during the COVID-19 pandemic for Spanish-speaking children with cleft palate: A systematic review.", "subfield": "Healthcare System", "authors": "Mirta Palomares-Aguilera, Felipe Inostroza-Allende, Loreley Riquelme Sol", "abstract": "Due to the lockdown and quarantines caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, the need to study and use telepractice for providing speech pathology interventions for children with cleft palate has arisen.To carry out a systematic review of the use of telepractice during the COVID-19 pandemic for providing speech pathology interventions for Spanish-speaking children with cleft palate.In July and August 2020, the authors searched the electronic databases Medline, LILACS, SciELO, and the Cochrane Library using the following keywords in English (MeSH): Cleft palate combined with Early intervention, Speech therapy, Rehabilitation of speech and language disorders, Speech production measurement, Speech articulation tests and Telemedicine. Original articles were selected and analyzed, complemented by an analysis of flowcharts and recommendations by the GES Clinical Guide of Cleft Lip and Palate of Chile's Government and the authors' expert opinions.A total of 2680 articles were retrieved, of which 23 were critically analyzed and used to adapt the early stimulation, evaluation, and treatment of children with CP to speech therapy telepractice at the Gantz Foundation, a Hospital in Santiago de Chile.Only three researchers carried out a quick review, which limited the depth of individual analysis of the studies included. Also, the suggestions and material presented should be evaluated in future investigations.This systematic review provides useful guidelines for providing speech pathology interventions through telepractice for children with cleft palate.

One of the reasons is linked to the cases of elder abuse, not only shown by academic and scientific sources, but also by social and mass media and their impact on public perception of the institutional setting. What is more, current COVID-19 pandemic consequences on older people have provoked alarm and worry especially about what is happening in institutions.The sample for this study consists of 286 staff working in nursing homes in Spain. This study aimed to assess the psychometric properties of the Professional Good Care Scale in Nursing Homes (GCS-NH).Results of parallel analyses and exploratory factor analyses (EFAs) showed a four-factor model for the 32-item scale: humanization (9 items), non-infantilization (10 items), respect (7 items) and empowerment (6 items). Then, psychometric properties were tested analysing internal consistency (reliability) and convergent, divergent and criterion validity. High internal consistency (reliability) and different validity evidence were obtained for the total scores of the GCS-NH and its subscales. GCS-NH scores were also capable of detecting risk of probable institutional elder abuse.Results show that this scale is an appropriate, valid, and reliable multidimensional instrument to evaluate good care in older institutionalized people by staff. Good care is an outcome of a complex construct in which a wide range of factors converge (staff, older people, and environmental characteristics). The GCS-NH has potential to be used as a multidimensional tool to assess good care.", "preprint": false}, "144774": {"doi": "10.7150/ijms.48614", "journal": "International journal of medical sciences", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33859519/", "date": "2021-04-17", "title": "Chest CT Imaging Features of Typical Covert COVID-19 Cases.", "subfield": "Symptoms", "authors": "Meng Dai, Liu Ouyang, Fan Yang, Heshui Shi, Jiazheng Wang, Xiaoyu Han, Osamah Alwalid, Yukun Cao, Dan Yang, Yuwen Li, Wenying Zhu, Jie L", "abstract": "", "preprint": false}, "144785": {"doi": "10.1186/s13244-021-00987-7\n10.1186/s13244-020-00933-z\n10.1148/radiol.2020200642\n10.1007/s00330-020-06801-0\n10.1007/s00330-020-06731-x\n10.1148/radiol.2017161659\n10.2214/ajr.170.2.9456931\n10.1164/rccm.202004-1278IM", "journal": "Insights into imaging", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33861380/", "date": "2021-04-17", "title": "One of the many faces of COVID-19 infection: an irregularly shaped pulmonary nodule.", "subfield": "Healthcare System", "authors": "Sevtap Arslan, Emre Ãn", "abstract": "", "preprint": false}, "144887": {"doi": "10.1080/1547691X.2021.1875085", "journal": "Journal of immunotoxicology", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33860730/", "date": "2021-04-17", "title": "From nicotine to the cholinergic anti-inflammatory reflex - Can nicotine alleviate the dysregulated inflammation in COVID-19?", "subfield": "Infection", "authors": "Alex G Gauthier, Mosi Lin, Jiaqi Wu, Thomas P Kennedy, Lee-Anne Daley, Charles R Ashby, Lin L Mante", "abstract": "The coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 of 2019 (COVID-19) causes a pandemic that has been diagnosed in more than 70 million people worldwide. Mild-to-moderate COVID-19 symptoms include coughing, fever, myalgia, shortness of breath, and acute inflammatory lung injury (ALI). In contrast, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and respiratory failure occur in patients diagnosed with severe COVID-19. ARDS is mediated, at least in part, by a dysregulated inflammatory response due to excessive levels of circulating cytokines, a condition known as the \"cytokine-storm syndrome.\" Currently, there are FDA-approved therapies that attenuate the dysregulated inflammation that occurs in COVID-19 patients, such as dexamethasone or other corticosteroids and IL-6 inhibitors, including sarilumab, tocilizumab, and siltuximab. However, the efficacy of these treatments have been shown to be inconsistent. Compounds that activate the vagus nerve-mediated cholinergic anti-inflammatory reflex, such as the Î±7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor agonist, GTS-21, attenuate ARDS/inflammatory lung injury by decreasing the extracellular levels of high mobility group box-1 (HMGB1) in the airways and the circulation. It is possible that HMGB1 may be an important mediator of the \"cytokine-storm syndrome.\" Notably, high plasma levels of HMGB1 have been reported in patients diagnosed with severe COVID-19, and there is a significant negative correlation between HMGB1 plasma levels and clinical outcomes. Nicotine can activate the cholinergic anti-inflammatory reflex, which attenuates the up-regulation and the excessive release of pro-inflammatory cytokines/chemokines.

possibilities for the treatment of moderate-to-severe psoriasis. Biologics currently approved for the treatment of psoriasis include tumor necrosis factor inhibitors, interleukin (IL)-17 inhibitors, ustekinumab (an IL-12/23 inhibitor), and IL-23 inhibitors. Data from clinical trials and studies of the safety and efficacy of biologics provide essential information for the personalization of patient care. We discuss the benefits and disadvantages of biologics as a first-line treatment choice, update treatment recommendations according to current evidence, and propose psoriasis treatment algorithms. Our discussion includes the following comorbid conditions: psoriatic arthritis, multiple sclerosis, congestive heart failure, inflammatory bowel disease, hepatitis B, nonmelanoma skin cancer, lymphoma, and latent tuberculosis. We make evidence-based treatment recommendations for special populations, including pediatric patients, patients with coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19), and pregnant and breastfeeding patients with psoriasis.

Vaccination against SARS-COV-2 holds promise for reduction in COVID-19. This operational analysis describes the proportion of SARS-COV-2 positive tests before, during, and after vaccination.Retrospective longitudinal cohort analysis from October 1, 2020 until February 14, 2021.130 Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Community Living Centers (CLC), analogous to nursing homes.Vaccination for SARS-CoV-2.The primary measure is the proportion of SARS-CoV-2 positive tests among CLC residents. In a pooled analysis of weekly testing and vaccine data, the proportion of positive tests was compared for the unvaccinated, 1st dose, and 2nd dose. For each CLC, we identified the week in which 50% of CLC residents were vaccinated (index week). The analysis aligned the index week for CLCs and examined the proportion of SARS-CoV-2 positive tests at the CLC level before and after. As a reference, we plotted the proportion of positive tests in nursing homes in the same county as the CLC using publicly reported data.Within the pooled VA CLCs, the first SARS-CoV-2 vaccine dose was delivered to 50% of CLC residents within 1âweek of availability and second dose within 5âweeks.

Traditional live-attenuated or inactivated viral vaccines are not recommended for immunocompromised patients as the attenuated virus can still cause disease via phenotypic or genotypic reversion. Subunit vaccines require repeated dosing and adjuvant use to be effective, and DNA vaccines exhibit lower immune responses. mRNA vaccines can be highly unstable under physiological conditions. On the other hand, naturally antigenic viral vectors with well-characterized structure and safety profile serve as among the most effective gene carriers to provoke immune response via heterologous gene transfer. Viral vector-based vaccines induce both an effective cellular immune response and a humoral immune response owing to their natural adjuvant properties via transduction of immune cells.

The precise mechanism of NK cell dysregulation is poorly understood, with little information on tissue margination or turnover.

COVID-19 outcomes are similar among patients with IBD and the overall population. Although biologics have not been shown to increase the risk of severe COVID-19 complications, several risk factors have been associated with negative COVID-19 outcomes in patients with IBD, including older age, obesity, the presence of comorbidities, active disease, and corticosteroid use. IBD therapy should, therefore, be continued with the aim of attaining or maintaining remission, except for corticosteroids, which should be held or reduced to the minimal effective dose. Although it has been recommended that immunosuppressive therapy be held during a case of COVID-19, the half-lives of these drugs and data on the timing of restarting therapy limit the strength of these recommendations.

The importance of airborne transmission of COVID-19 is now widely recognized. While tools for risk assessment have recently been developed, no safety guideline has been proposed to protect against it. We here build on models of airborne disease transmission in order to derive an indoor safety guideline that would impose an upper bound on the \"cumulative exposure time,\" the product of the number of occupants and their time in an enclosed space. We demonstrate how this bound depends on the rates of ventilation and air filtration, dimensions of the room, breathing rate, respiratory activity and face mask use of its occupants, and infectiousness of the respiratory aerosols. By synthesizing available data from the best-characterized indoor spreading events with respiratory drop size distributions, we estimate an infectious dose on the order of 10 aerosol-borne virions. The new virus (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 [SARS-CoV-2]) is thus inferred to be an order of magnitude more infectious than its forerunner (SARS-CoV), consistent with the pandemic status achieved by COVID-19. Case studies are presented for classrooms and nursing homes, and a spreadsheet and online app are provided to facilitate use of our guideline.

Researchers have developed a specific conceptual framework and identified potential causal mechanisms. Proximal and more distal intervention effects will be measured with five instruments, implemented pre- and post-interventions between 2018 and 2021: a household survey, an observation tool to evaluate dwelling conditions, hygrochrons for measuring temperature and humidity inside dwellings, systematic observation of recreational areas, and qualitative interviews. Survey baseline data (956 households, 3130 individuals) is presented to describe sociodemographics, housing and health characteristics of both cohorts, noting that neighborhoods studied show worse conditions than the Chilean population.RUCAS' design allows for a comprehensive evaluation of the effects that the intervention could have on various dimensions of health and health determinants. RUCAS will face some challenges, like changes in the intervention process due to adjustments of the master plan, exogenous factors -including COVID-19 pandemic and associated lockdowns- and lost to follow-up. Given the stepped wedge design, that the study capitalizes on within household changes over time, the possibility of adjusting data collection process and complementarity of methods, RUCAS has the flexibility to adapt to these circumstances.

A subset of 202 viral pneumonia patients with concurrent acute respiratory distress syndrome was examined separately.None.Mean age was 63.4 for coronavirus disease (p = 0.064) versus 64.1 for viral pneumonia. Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation-IV scores were similar at 56.7 and 55.0, respectively (p = 0.060), but gender and ethnic distributions differed, as did PaO2 to FIO2 ratio and WBC count at admission. The hospital standardized mortality ratio (95% CI) was 1.52 (1.35-1.68) for coronavirus disease patients and 0.82 (0.75-0.90) for viral pneumonia patients. In the coronavirus disease group, ICU and hospital length of stay were 3.1 and 3.0 days longer than in viral pneumonia patients. Standardized ICU and hospital length of stay ratios were 1.13 and 1.46 in the coronavirus disease group versus 0.95 and 0.94 in viral pneumonia patients. Forty-seven percent of coronavirus disease patients received invasive or noninvasive ventilatory support on their first ICU day versus 65% with viral pneumonia. Ventilator days in survivors were longer in coronavirus disease (10.4 d) than in viral pneumonia (4.3 d) patients, except in the viral pneumonia-acute respiratory distress syndrome subgroup (10.2 d) CONCLUSIONS:: Severity-adjusted mortality and length of stay are higher for coronavirus disease 2019 patients than for viral pneumonia patients admitted to ICU.

Moreover, the impact of CP treatment on the composition of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in COVID-19 patients and antibody markers that differentiate between those who survive and those who succumb to the COVID-19 disease are not well understood. Herein, we performed longitudinal analysis of antibody profile on 115 sequential plasma samples from 16 hospitalized COVID-19 patients treated with either CP or standard of care, only half of them survived. Differential antibody kinetics was observed for antibody binding, IgM/IgG/IgA distribution, and affinity maturation in 'survived' vs. 'fatal' COVID-19 patients. Surprisingly, CP treatment did not predict survival. Strikingly, marked decline in neutralization titers was observed in the fatal patients prior to death, and convalescent plasma treatment did not reverse this trend. Furthermore, irrespective of CP treatment, higher antibody affinity to the SARS-CoV-2 prefusion spike was associated with survival outcome, while sustained elevated IgA response was associated with fatal outcome in these COVID-19 patients.

Timely diagnosis and hospitalization, risk stratification, effective utilization of intensive care services, selection of appropriate therapies, monitoring and timely discharge are essential to save the maximum number of lives. Clinical assessment is indispensable, but laboratory markers, or biomarkers, can provide additional, objective information which can significantly impact these components of patient care. COVID-19 is not a localized respiratory infection but a multisystem disease caused by a diffuse systemic process involving a complex interplay of the immunological, inflammatory and coagulative cascades. The understanding of what the virus does to the body and how the body reacts to it has uncovered a gamut of potential biomarkers. This review discusses the different classes of biomarkers - immunological, inflammatory, coagulation, hematological, cardiac, biochemical and miscellaneous - in terms of their pathophysiological basis followed by the current evidence. Differences between children and adults are highlighted. The role of biomarkers in the diagnosis and management of Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C) is reviewed. The correlation of biomarkers with clinical and radiological features and the viral load, temporal evolution and the effect of treatment remain to be studied in detail.

Obwohl die Diagnose von COVID-19 mittels Nasopharyngealabstrich erfolgt, ist der Nachweis einer pulmonalen Beteiligung fÃ¼r die sichere Entlassung des Patienten von entscheidender Bedeutung. Die Computertomografie (CT) ist derzeit der Goldstandard. Um paucisymptomatische Patienten zu behandeln, haben wir in unserer Notaufnahme einen âFast Trackâ-Pfad implementiert, der LUS als valide Alternative nutzt. In der Literatur gibt es nur wenige Daten zur Inter-Observer-ReliabilitÃ¤t und den Grad der Expertise, die fÃ¼r eine zuverlÃ¤ssige Untersuchung erforderlich sind. Unser Ziel war es daher, diese zu bewerten.âEs handelte sich um eine prospektive Single-Center-Studie. Wir haben 96 Patienten eingeschlossen. Bei jedem Patienten wurden 12 Lungenbereiche mit semiquantitativer Bewertung des pulmonalen BelÃ¼ftungsverlustes untersucht, um den LUS-Score zu erhalten. Die Scans wurden von 2 verschiedenen Anwendern, einem Experten und einem Neuling, durchgefÃ¼hrt, die gegenÃ¼ber den Ergebnissen ihres Kollegen verblindet waren.â96 Patienten wurden in die Studie aufgenommen. Der Intraklassen-Korrelationskoeffizient (ICC) zeigte eine ausgezeichnete Ãbereinstimmung zwischen dem Experten und dem Neuanwender (ICC 0,975; 0,962â0,983). Demografische Merkmale (Alter, Geschlecht und chronische Lungenerkrankung) hatten keinen Einfluss auf die Reproduzierbarkeit der Methode. Der ICC betrug 0,973 (0,950â0,986) bei MÃ¤nnern; 0,976 (0,959â0,986) bei Frauen; 0,965 (0,940â0,980) bei jÃ¼ngeren Patienten (â¤â46 Jahre) und 0,973 (0,952â0,985) bei Ã¤lteren Patienten (>â46 Jahre). Der ICC betrug 0,967 (0,882â0,991) bei Patienten mit Lungenerkrankungen und 0,975 (0,962â0,984) bei den anderen Patienten.

Though there is a high degree of ORF10 protein similarity of SARS-CoV-2 and Pangolin-CoV, there are differences of these two ORF10 proteins related to their sub-structure (loop/coil region), solubility, antigenicity and shift from strand to coil at aa position 26 (tyrosine). SARS-CoV-2 ORF10, which is apparently expressed in vivo since reactive T cell clones are found in convalescent patients should be monitored for changes which could correlate with the pathogenesis of COVID-19.", "preprint": false}, "144642": {"doi": "10.1128/MRA.00248-21\n10.7150/ijbs.48812\n10.1016/j.heliyon.2020.e04743\n10.3390/v12080880\n10.1128/JVI.00747-06\n10.1093/molbev/msu300\n10.1007/s00705-015-2592-y", "journal": "Microbiology resource announcements", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33858932/", "date": "2021-04-17", "title": "Coding-Complete Genome Sequence of Murine Hepatitis Virus Strain 3 from Brazil.", "subfield": "Vaccination", "authors": "Amanda Barbosa Garcia, Ana Paula de Moraes, Daniele Masselli Rodrigues, Rovilson Gilioli, Edmilson Ferreira de Oliveira-Filho, Ricardo DurÃ£es-Carvalho, Clarice Weis Ar", "abstract": "Murine hepatitis virus (MHV) strain 3, one of the most important inducers of viral hepatitis, has been extensively studied as an organism to gain a better understanding of coronavirus biology and pathogenesis.

We aim to estimate the effects of hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine on survival in COVID-19 from all currently available RCT evidence, published and unpublished. We present a rapid meta-analysis of ongoing, completed, or discontinued RCTs on hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine treatment for any COVID-19 patients (protocol: https://osf.io/QESV4/ ). We systematically identified unpublished RCTs (ClinicalTrials.gov, WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, Cochrane COVID-registry up to June 11, 2020), and published RCTs (PubMed, medRxiv and bioRxiv up to October 16, 2020). All-cause mortality has been extracted (publications/preprints) or requested from investigators and combined in random-effects meta-analyses, calculating odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs), separately for hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine. Prespecified subgroup analyses include patient setting, diagnostic confirmation, control type, and publication status. Sixty-three trials were potentially eligible. We included 14 unpublished trials (1308 patients) and 14 publications/preprints (9011 patients). Results for hydroxychloroquine are dominated by RECOVERY and WHO SOLIDARITY, two highly pragmatic trials, which employed relatively high doses and included 4716 and 1853 patients, respectively (67% of the total sample size). The combined OR on all-cause mortality for hydroxychloroquine isÂ 1.11 (95% CI: 1.02, 1.20; IÂ²â=â0%; 26 trials; 10,012 patients) and for chloroquine 1.77 (95%CI: 0.15, 21.13, IÂ²â=â0%; 4 trials; 307 patients).

Regarding the differences in the infection rate observed in each region, additionally to studies investigating the causes of differences in population density as a proxy for social distancing, an increasing trend of studies investigating the causes of differences in social capital has also been seen (ie, value sharing, acceptance of norms, unity, and trust through reciprocity). However, studies investigating whether social capital that controls the effects of population density also influences the infection rate are limited. Therefore, in this study, we analyzed the relationship between infection rate, population density, and social capital using statistical data of Japan's every prefecture. Statistical analysis showed that social capital not only negatively correlates with infection rates and population densities, but also negatively correlates with infection rates controlling for the effects of population density. Additionally, controlling the relationship between the variables by mean age showed that social capital had a greater correlation with infection rate than population density. In other words, social capital mediates the relationship between population density and infection rates, indicating that social distancing alone is not enough to deter coronavirus disease; social capital needs to be recharged.", "preprint": false}, "144685": {"doi": "10.1111/famp.12647", "journal": "Family process", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33861867/", "date": "2021-04-17", "title": "Couples Therapists' Attitudes Toward Online Therapy During the COVID-19 Crisis.", "subfield": "Healthcare System", "authors": "Reut Machluf, Michal Abba Daleski, Ben Shahar, Ofra Kula, Eran Bar-Kali", "abstract": "The measures adopted by governments around the world to control the spread of the COVID-19 virus (e.g., social distancing) have propelled a rapid transition from face-to-face to online therapy. Studies on online individual therapy indicate that therapists often have favorable attitudes toward this modality. To date, there is scant work on couples therapists' attitudes, despite the fact that the provision of online couples' therapy poses unique challenges (e.g., dealing with escalating conflict remotely). To provide a snapshot, in real time, as to how therapists experience the transition to online therapy, we surveyed 166 Israeli couples' therapists during April 2020, when lockdown orders prevented therapists from seeing couples face-to-face. A few weeks later, when the stay-at-home policy was lifted, a subsample (NÂ =Â 60) of these therapists completed a follow-up assessment. The results suggest that couples therapists had limited experience using the online modality prior to COVID. The therapists reported experiencing online couples' therapy as somewhat successful and that their experience of providing therapy during the COVID-19 crisis had an overall positive impact on their attitudes toward online work. Establishing a strong therapeutic bond with both partners, dealing with escalating conflict, and treatment dropout were identified as the issues of most concern when conducting online couples therapy. The perceived difficulties with online therapy prospectively predicted lower usage of online couples' therapy, as well as less intention to continue online treatment once the crisis is over.Las medidas adoptadas por los gobiernos de todo el mundo para controlar la propagaciÃ³n del virus de la COVID-19 (p. ej.: el distanciamiento social) han impulsado una transiciÃ³n rÃ¡pida de la terapia presencial a la terapia virtual. Los estudios sobre la terapia individual virtual indican que los terapeutas con frecuencia tienen actitudes favorables hacia esta modalidad. Hasta la fecha, los trabajos sobre las actitudes de los terapeutas de pareja son escasos, a pesar del hecho de que la prÃ¡ctica de la terapia de pareja virtual plantea desafÃ­os Ãºnicos (p. ej.: manejar la intensificaciÃ³n del conflicto distancia). Para ofrecer un panorama en tiempo real sobre cÃ³mo viven los terapeutas la transiciÃ³n a la terapia virtual, encuestamos a 166 terapeutas de pareja israelÃ­es durante abril de 2020, cuando las Ã³rdenes de confinamiento impidieron a los terapeutas ver a las parejas en persona. Algunas semanas despuÃ©s, cuando se levantÃ³ la orden de quedarse en casa, una submuestra (N=60) de estos terapeutas completÃ³ una evaluaciÃ³n de seguimiento. Los resultados sugieren que los terapeutas de pareja tenÃ­an poca experiencia en el uso de la modalidad virtual antes de la COVID-19. Los terapeutas informaron que vivieron la terapia de pareja virtual como bastante favorable y que su experiencia de ofrecer terapia durante la crisis de la COVID-19 tuvo un efecto general positivo en sus actitudes hacia el trabajo virtual. Los problemas identificados como los de mayor preocupaciÃ³n a la hora de ofrecer terapia de pareja virtual fueron los siguientes: la construcciÃ³n de un vÃ­nculo terapÃ©utico sÃ³lido con ambos integrantes de la pareja, el manejo de la intensificaciÃ³n del conflicto y el abandono del tratamiento. Las dificultades percibidas con la terapia virtual predijeron prospectivamente un menor uso de la terapia de pareja virtual, asÃ­ como menos intenciones de continuar el tratamiento virtual una vez que termine la crisis.ä¸çåå½æ¿åºä¸ºæ§å¶COVID-19çæ¯ä¼ æ­èéåçæªæ½(å¦ä¿æç¤¾äº¤è·ç¦»)æ¨å¨äºé¢å¯¹é¢æ²»çåç½ç»å¨çº¿æ²»ççå¿«éè½¬åãå¯¹å¨çº¿ä¸ªä½æ²»ççç ç©¶è¡¨æï¼æ²»çå¸éå¸¸å¯¹è¿ç§æ¹å¼æç§¯ææåº¦ãè¿ä»ä¸ºæ­¢ï¼å³äºä¼´ä¾£æ²»çå¸æåº¦çç ç©¶å¾å°ï¼å°½ç®¡æä¾å¨çº¿ä¼´ä¾£æ²»çä¼å¸¦æ¥ç¬ç¹çææ(ä¾å¦ï¼è¿ç¨å¤çä¸æ­åçº§çå²çª)ãä¸ºäºæä¾æ²»çå¸å¦ä½ä½éªåå¨çº¿æ²»çè¿æ¸¡çå®æ¶æ¦åµï¼æä»¬å¨2020å¹´4æè°æ¥äº166åä»¥è²åä¼´ä¾£æ²»çå¸ï¼å½æ¶å°éä»¤ç¦æ­¢æ²»çå¸é¢å¯¹é¢å°ä¸ä¼´ä¾£æ¥è®¿èè§é¢ãå å¨åï¼å½å±å®¶æ¿ç­è¢«åæ¶æ¶ï¼å¯¹è¿äºæ²»çå¸çå­æ ·æ¬(N=60)å®æäºéè®¿è¯ä¼°ãç»æè¡¨æï¼ä¼´ä¾£æ²»çå¸å¨COVID - 19ä¹åä½¿ç¨å¨çº¿æ¨¡å¼çç»éªå¹¶ä¸å¤ãæ²»çå¸æ¥åç§°ï¼ä»ä»¬ä½éªçå¨çº¿ä¼´ä¾£æ²»çå¯ä»¥ç®æ¯æ¯è¾æåï¼ä»ä»¬å¨COVID-19å±æºæé´æä¾æ²»ççç»åå¯¹ä»ä»¬å¯¹å¨çº¿å·¥ä½çæåº¦äº§çäºæ»ä½ç§¯æçå½±åãç ç©¶è¡¨æå¨çº¿ä¼´ä¾£æ²»çæ¶æéè¦å³æ³¨çé®é¢æä»¥ä¸å ä¸ªæ¹é¢ï¼ä¸ä¼´ä¾£åæ¹å»ºç«å¼ºæåçå»æ£å³ç³»ï¼å¤çä¸æ­åçº§çå²çªï¼ä»¥åæ²»çä¸­ééåºãå¯é¢è§çå¨çº¿æ²»çé¢ä¸´çå°é¾é¢ç¤ºçå¨çº¿ä¼´ä¾£æ²»ççä½¿ç¨çä¼éä½ï¼ä¸æ¦å±æºç»æåï¼ç»§ç»­ä½¿ç¨å¨çº¿æ²»ççææ¿ä¹ä¼éä½ã.", "preprint": false}, "144863": {"doi": "10.12788/fp.0094", "journal": "Federal practitioner : for the health care professionals of the VA, DoD, and PHS", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33859466/", "date": "2021-04-17", "title": "Postoperative Neurologic Deficits in a Veteran With Recent COVID-19.", "subfield": "Treatment", "authors": "Brian Tolly, Asish Abraham, Malik Ghannam, Jamie Starks, Liviu Poli", "abstract": "", "preprint": false}, "144883": {"doi": "10.7150/ijms.53270", "journal": "International journal of medical sciences", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33859521/", "date": "2021-04-17", "title": "Nosocomial Infection Outbreak due to SARS-COV-2 in a Hospital Unit of Particularly Vulnerable Patients.", "subfield": "Treatment", "authors": "RocÃ­o Seijo Bestilleiro, Diana Martinez SeÃ±aris, MarÃ­a JosÃ© Pereira RodrÃ­guez, Rita Galeiras VÃ¡zquez, Raquel GarcÃ­a RodrÃ­guez, MarÃ­a Teresa GarcÃ­a Rodriguez, Cristina GonzÃ¡lez MartÃ­n, MarÃ­a Teresa Seoane Pillado, Vanesa Balboa Barreiro, ValentÃ­n ValdÃ©s ValiÃ±a, Sonia PÃ©rtega DÃ­", "abstract": "", "preprint": false}, "144819": {"doi": "10.2337/dc20-2676", "journal": "Diabetes care", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33858854/", "date": "2021-04-17", "title": "Diabetes and Overweight/Obesity Are Independent, Nonadditive Risk Factors for In-Hospital Severity of COVID-19: An International, Multicenter Retrospective Meta-analysis.", "subfield": "Clinical Studies", "authors": "Danielle K Longmore, Jessica E Miller, Siroon Bekkering, Christoph Saner, Edin Mifsud, Yanshan Zhu, Richard Saffery, Alistair Nichol, Graham Colditz, Kirsty R Short, David P Burgner, ", "abstract": "Obesity is an established risk factor for severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), but the contribution of overweight and/or diabetes remains unclear.

In spite of this, no study has assessed the relationship between safety attitudes and psychological outcomes. Moreover, only limited studies have examined the relationship between personal characteristics and psychological outcomes during Covid-19. From 22nd March 2020 to 18th June 2020, healthcare workers from the United Kingdom, Poland, and Singapore were invited to participate using a self-administered questionnaire comprising the Safety Attitudes Questionnaire (SAQ), Oldenburg Burnout Inventory (OLBI) and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) to evaluate safety culture, burnout and anxiety/depression. Multivariate logistic regression was used to determine predictors of burnout, anxiety and depression. Of 3,537 healthcare workers who participated in the study, 2,364 (67%) screened positive for burnout, 701 (20%) for anxiety, and 389 (11%) for depression. Significant predictors of burnout included patient-facing roles: doctor (OR 2.10; 95% CI 1.49-2.95), nurse (OR 1.38; 95% CI 1.04-1.84), and 'other clinical' (OR 2.02; 95% CI 1.45-2.82); being redeployed (OR 1.27; 95% CI 1.02-1.58), bottom quartile SAQ score (OR 2.43; 95% CI 1.98-2.99), anxiety (OR 4.87; 95% CI 3.92-6.06) and depression (OR 4.06; 95% CI 3.04-5.42). Significant factors inversely correlated with burnout included being tested for SARS-CoV-2 (OR 0.64; 95% CI 0.51-0.82) and top quartile SAQ score (OR 0.30; 95% CI 0.22-0.40). Significant factors associated with anxiety and depression, included burnout, gender, safety attitudes and job role. Our findings demonstrate a significant burden of burnout, anxiety, and depression amongst healthcare workers. A strong association was seen between SARS-CoV-2 testing, safety attitudes, gender, job role, redeployment and psychological state. These findings highlight the importance of targeted support services for at risk groups and proactive SARS-CoV-2 testing of healthcare workers.", "preprint": false}, "144740": {"doi": "10.32641/rchped.vi91i6.3338", "journal": "Revista chilena de pediatria", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33861841/", "date": "2021-04-17", "title": "Acute kidney injury in COVID-19.", "subfield": "Infection", "authors": "Felipe Cavagnaro Sm, Christian Scheu Goncalv", "abstract": "", "preprint": false}, "144741": {"doi": "10.3389/fsurg.2021.657901", "journal": "Frontiers in surgery", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33859995/", "date": "2021-04-17", "title": "Augmented Reality in Medical Practice: From Spine Surgery to Remote Assistance.", "subfield": "Treatment", "authors": "Fabio Cofano, Giuseppe Di Perna, Marco Bozzaro, Alessandro Longo, Nicola Marengo, Francesco Zenga, Nicola Zullo, Matteo Cavalieri, Luca Damiani, Daniya J Boges, Marco Agus, Diego Garbossa, Corrado Ca", "abstract": "", "preprint": false}, "144831": {"doi": "10.1016/j.addbeh.2021.106917", "journal": "Addictive behaviors", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33862579/", "date": "2021-04-17", "title": "How the COVID-19 pandemic impacts tobacco addiction: Changes in smoking behavior and associations with well-being.", "subfield": "Mental Health", "authors": "Haiyang Yang, Jingjing ", "abstract": "This research investigated (1) how the coronavirus pandemic impacted tobacco addiction, (2) which smoker segments were more vulnerable, and (3) how the changes in tobacco consumption were associated with smokers' satisfaction with physical health and psychological well-being. Data from a large-scale cross-sectional study of adults in China were analyzed. Outcome measures were the quantity of cigarettes consumed per day prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, the quantity after the nationwide outbreak had been contained, satisfaction with physical health, and emotional well-being. Analyses revealed that, after the nationwide outbreak, more individuals quit (vs. started) smoking. Compared to their pre-COVID-19 consumption levels, smokers significantly reduced the quantity of cigarettes they consumed after the nationwide outbreak had been contained. However, there were substantial disparities across individuals: male (vs. female) smokers were less able to curb their smoking; smokers residing in urban (vs. rural) areas or with a longer smoking history were also less able to reduce their smoking. Importantly, a greater reduction in smoking was associated with higher satisfaction with physical health and better emotional well-being. Furthermore, a follow-up investigation revealed that concerns about increased COVID-19 health risks due to smoking were a primary factor driving smokers' behavior change.

Both groups were compared in order to find differences in the epidemiologic profile of burned patients.A total of 350 burns cases were analyzed. A 36% reduction in the number of emergency department visits was identified during Period 1. However, we found an increase in the rate of hospital admissions in Period 1 (20% of the burn cases) compared with Period 2 (13% of the burn cases). Seventy-six burn-related primary admissions were analyzed: 37 patients were admitted during Period 1 and 39 patients during Period 2. No differences were found between the two periods in the proportion of patients that underwent surgical treatment: 59.5% of patients admitted during Period 1 and 61.5% of patients admitted during Period 2. A statistically significant increase was noted in the rate of paediatric (aged 0-16 years old) admissions during Period 1 (40.54%, n = 15) compared to Period 2 (20.5%, n = 8). Among paediatric patients, an increase in the rate of surgical procedures was noted in Period 1 (47% of children), compared with Period 2 (37% of children). Proportion of patients that were admitted to the Intensive Care Unit was higher among burn children admitted during period 1 (46.7%, n = 7) than those admitted during Period 2 (25%, n = 2). Among the 37 patients admitted during the lockdown period, two positive COVID-19 patients were confirmed.This study gives an overview of the clinical and epidemiologic profile of burned patients during the stringent lockdown in Spain forced by the COVID-19 epidemic. Our data shows a stable trend in the number of burn-related admissions and burn related-surgeries during the confinement period.

In response to university lockdowns, most respondents transitioned from traditional labs to remote formats within a week or less. The most common remote delivery formats were commercially available online physiology laboratories, homemade videos, and sample experimental data. The main challenges associated with the rapid remote transition included workload and expertise constraints, disparities in online access and workspaces, issues with academic integrity, educator and student stress, changes in learning outcomes, and reduced engagement.

SARS-CoV-2 naÃ¯ve individuals required both vaccine doses for optimal increases in antibodies, particularly for neutralizing titers against the B.1.351 variant. Memory B cells specific for full-length spike protein and the spike receptor binding domain (RBD) were also efficiently primed by mRNA vaccination and detectable in all SARS-CoV-2 naive subjects after the second vaccine dose, though the memory B cell response declined slightly with age. In SARS-CoV-2 recovered individuals, antibody and memory B cell responses were significantly boosted after the first vaccine dose; however, there was no increase in circulating antibodies, neutralizing titers, or antigen-specific memory B cells after the second dose. This robust boosting after the first vaccine dose strongly correlated with levels of pre-existing memory B cells in recovered individuals, identifying a key role for memory B cells in mounting recall responses to SARS-CoV-2 antigens. Together, our data demonstrated robust serological and cellular priming by mRNA vaccines and revealed distinct responses based on prior SARS-CoV-2 exposure, whereby COVID-19 recovered subjects may only require a single vaccine dose to achieve peak antibody and memory B cell responses.

Clinical variables including onset of symptoms, hemodynamic instability, associated complications, the need of interventions, and disease course were all recorded. Also, radiological findings such as the presence of the Macklin effect, extension of lung involvement by COVID-19, and characteristics of the PM were analyzed.Twenty-one patients with non-traumatic PM were followed, resulting in an overall incidence of 0.5% during the study period. Seven (33%) patients had associated pneumothorax and malignant/tension PM was observed in three (14%) cases. The Macklin effect could be found in 11 patients (52%) and the majority of them had more than 50% of lung involvement due to COVID-19. The mortality rate was 49%; however, no deaths were directly related to the PM.PM incidence is probably increased in the severe acute respiratory syndrome caused by COVID-19, especially in those with greater involvement of the lungs, and the Macklin effect may be an important underlying mechanism of this complication.

However, outside of the short sniffing bouts, a more stableâ~â2Â Hz RR was recently shown to rhythmically modulate non-olfactory cognitive processes, as well. The underlying RR coupling with wide-spread forebrain activity was confirmed using advanced techniques, creating solid premise for investigating how higher networks use this mechanism in their communication. Here we show essential differences in the way prefrontal cortex (PFC) and hippocampus (HC) process the RR signal from the olfactory bulb (OB) that may support dynamic, flexible PFC-HC coupling utilizing this input. We used inter-regional coherences and their correlations in rats, breathing at low rate (~â2Â Hz), outside of the short sniffing bouts. We found strong and stable OB-PFC coherence in wake states, contrasting OB-HC coherence which was low but highly variable. Importantly, this variability was essential for establishing PFC-HC synchrony at RR, whereas variations of RRO in OB and PFC had no significant effect. The findings help to understand the mechanism of rhythmic modulation of non-olfactory cognitive processes by the on-going regular respiration, reported in rodents as well as humans.

In Ecuador, a Knowledge, Attitudes and Practices (KAP) survey was conducted. In Sri Lanka, an evaluation of a novel medicine delivery system was conducted. Using the established mobile network operator channels and technical assistance provided through The Bloomberg Philanthropies Data for Health Initiative (D4H), Ministries of Health fielded a population-based COVID-19-specific MPS using Surveda, the open source data collection tool developed as part of the initiative. A total of 1,185 adults in Ecuador completed the MPS in 14 days. A total of 5,001 adults over the age of 35 in Sri Lanka completed the MPS in 44 days. Both samples were adjusted to the 2019 United Nations Population Estimates to produce population-based estimates by age and sex. The Ecuador COVID-19 MPS found that there was compliance with the mitigation strategies implemented in that country. Overall, 96.5% of Ecuadorians reported wearing a face mask or face covering when leaving home. Overall, 3.8% of Sri Lankans used the service to receive medicines from a government clinic.

SARS-CoV-2 was isolated from fecal samples, and active viral replication was reported in human intestinal cells. The human gut also harbors an enormous amount of resident viruses (collectively known as the virome) that play a role in regulating host immunity and disease pathophysiology. Understanding gut virome perturbation that underlies SARS-CoV-2 infection and severity is an unmet need.We enrolled 98 COVID-19 patients with varying disease severity (3 asymptomatic, 53 mild, 34 moderate, 5 severe, 3 critical) and 78 non-COVID-19 controls matched for gender and co-morbidities. All subjects had fecal specimens sampled at inclusion. Blood specimens were collected for COVID-19 patients at admission to test for inflammatory markers and white cell counts. Among COVID-19 cases, 37 (38%) patients had serial fecal samples collected 2 to 3 times per week from time of hospitalization until after discharge. Using shotgun metagenomics sequencing, we sequenced and profiled the fecal RNA and DNA virome. We investigated alterations and longitudinal dynamics of the gut virome in association with disease severity and blood parameters.Patients with COVID-19 showed underrepresentation of Pepper mild mottle virus (RNA virus) and multiple bacteriophage lineages (DNA viruses) and enrichment of environment-derived eukaryotic DNA viruses in fecal samples, compared to non-COVID-19 subjects. Such gut virome alterations persisted up to 30 days after disease resolution. Fecal virome in SARS-CoV-2 infection harbored more stress-, inflammation-, and virulence-associated gene encoding capacities including those pertaining to bacteriophage integration, DNA repair, and metabolism and virulence associated with their bacterial host. Baseline fecal abundance of 10 virus species (1 RNA virus, pepper chlorotic spot virus, and 9 DNA virus species) inversely correlated with disease COVID-19 severity. These viruses inversely correlated with blood levels of pro-inflammatory proteins, white cells, and neutrophils. Among the 10 COVID-19 severity-associated DNA virus species, 4 showed inverse correlation with age; 5 showed persistent lower abundance both during disease course and after disease resolution relative to non-COVID-19 subjects.Both enteric RNA and DNA virome in COVID-19 patients were different from non-COVID-19 subjects, which persisted after disease resolution of COVID-19. Gut virome may calibrate host immunity and regulate severity to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Our observation that gut viruses inversely correlated with both severity of COVID-19 and host age may partly explain that older subjects are prone to severe and worse COVID-19 outcomes. Altogether, our data highlight the importance of human gut virome in severity and potentially therapeutics of COVID-19.

However, significant overall effects were still present after 24 months for LBM and body fat indices but not for the MetSZ.The present study clearly indicates the unfavorable effects of 6 months of detraining after HIT-RT.

Enhanced surveillance systems for early threat detection will be crucial to maximizing response time for implementation of public health measures and mobilization of resources in containing an emerging pandemic. Recent outbreaks have been dominated by viral pathogens with RNA respiratory viruses being the most likely to have pandemic potential. These should therefore be a preparedness priority. Tools in the areas of virology, drug discovery, clinical pharmacology, translational medicine, and pharmacometrics should be considered key components in the rapid identification and development of existing and novel interventions for a pandemic response. Prioritization of therapeutics should be based on in vitro activity, likelihood of achieving effective drug concentrations at the site of action, and safety profile at the doses that will be required for clinical efficacy. Deployment strategies must be tailored to the epidemiology of the disease, and the adequacy of the response should be re-evaluated in view of evolving epidemiological factors. An interdisciplinary framework integrating drug pharmacology, viral kinetics, epidemiology and health economics could help optimize the deployment strategy by improving decision-making around who to treat, when to treat, and with what type of intervention for optimal outcomes.

We review the existing literature regarding the function of ACE2 and the renin-angiotensin system in the female and male reproductive systems to postulate the possible implications of SARS-CoV-2 regarding fertility. Because of the presence of ACE2 in the ovaries, SARS-CoV-2 infection may disrupt ovarian function and hence oocyte quality.

Data on types and duration of symptoms were obtained from longitudinal reports from users of the COVID Symptom Study app who reported a positive test for COVID-19 between Sept 28 and Dec 27, 2020 (during which the prevalence of B.1.1.7 increased most notably in parts of the UK). From this dataset, we also estimated the frequency of possible reinfection, defined as the presence of two reported positive tests separated by more than 90 days with a period of reporting no symptoms for more than 7 days before the second positive test.

Electronic, geographically indexed resource database systems have the potential to provide an efficient way for emergency physicians to rapidly identify community resources in settings where immediate social work consultation is not accessible.We conducted a systematic review of papers examining the use of geographically indexed resource database systems in healthcare to better understand how these services can be used in emergency care. We then conducted simulated, standardized searches using two nationally available databases (211 and Aunt Bertha), applied to a single metropolitan area (Boston).Our systematic review found that most public health and screening interventions using nationally available databases have focused on chronic care needs. A small subset of publications demonstrated that these databases were mobilized during disasters to successfully aid vulnerable populations during Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. A total of 408 standardized searches were conducted to identify community resources related to four domains of social needs (food, transportation, housing, and utilities).

Several hours after vaccination, he developed significant epistaxis and cutaneous purpura. Severe thrombocytopenia was documented the following day, and he developed extremity weakness and encephalopathy with facial muscle weakness. Over a 14-day period, thrombocytopenia was treated first with high dose dexamethasone, intravenous immunoglobulin, platelet transfusions, rituximab, plasma exchange (for presumed acute inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (AIDP)), and four daily doses of the thrombopoietin receptor agonist (TPO-RA) eltrombopag (Promactaâ¢), without a platelet response. Three days later, he received the TPO-RA romiplostim (Nplateâ¢). Five days later, his platelet count began to rise and by post-vaccination day 25, his platelet count was in the normal range. Thrombocytopenia was refractory to frontline and second-line treatment. The eventual rise in his platelet count suggests that one or both TPO-RAs may have impacted platelet recovery.

COVID-19 has overtaxed health systems, disrupted routine immunization programs, forced school and workplace closures, impeded the operation of international supply chains, suppressed aggregate demand, and exacerbated existing social inequities.The obvious nature of the pandemic's broad effects could conceivably convince more policymakers to identify and account for the full societal impacts of infectious disease when evaluating the potential benefits of vaccination.

This study sought to gain insight into the impact of the current situation on people with MS and the factors that influence this.324 MS patients participated in this online cross-sectional survey during the COVID-19 lockdown period. A mixed methods design was used, with quantitative information collected on MS-related factors as well as COVID-19 impact and an open-ended, qualitative response looking for reasons behind the self-reported COVID-19 impact.We found that 48% of the participants reported that COVID-19 had a neutral impact on their lives and 16% reported a positive impact. However, 36% reported a negative impact, and had greater levels of MS- and non-MS-related worries, and higher levels of bother related to psychological and cognitive symptoms and fatigue than the groups reporting a neutral or positive impact. Significant predictors of this adversely affected group were age, type of MS and presence of psychological symptoms. Antidepressant medication use, time since diagnosis, gender, location, living arrangements or employment status did not predict impact. Open-ended responses explaining personal COVID-19 impact indicate that coping strategies may contribute to these findings. In particular, active, problem-focused approaches were reported by the majority of people who reported a positive impact, as well as a third of those who reported a neutral impact.These findings suggest that younger people, those with progressive types of MS, and those with psychological symptoms are particularly vulnerable to the negative effects of a COVID-19 pandemic induced lockdown. Coping strategies provide further insight into these findings with those reporting active problem-focused approaches seemingly faring better than those who do not state any coping strategies. These results also have implications for understanding other like neurological conditions that share many similarities with MS and how best to direct support.People with Multiple Sclerosis (MS) are more vulnerable to psychological disorders such as anxiety. Consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic could potentially heighten these levels due to the impact on health and healthcare. An online survey was completed by 324 people with MS during the COVID-19 pandemic to identify the level of COVID-19 impact (positive, neutral or negative) and the reasons why they felt this way. Findings show that just under half of people who completed the survey reported a neutral impact, with a negative impact reported by just over a third of participants. Having a progressive diagnosis of MS, being younger and having psychological symptoms predicted a negative impact. Coping strategies also appear to play a part in the COVID-19 experience for people with MS, with active, problem-focused strategies being an approach used by nearly all who reported a positive impact and over a third of people who reported a neutral impact.

Decision support tools of risk stratification are needed to predict outcomes in patients with different clinical types of COVID-19.This retrospective cohort study recruited 2425 patients with moderate or severe COVID-19. A logistic regression model was used to select and estimate the factors independently associated with outcomes. Simplified risk stratification score systems were constructed to predict outcomes in moderate and severe patients with COVID-19, and their performances were evaluated by discrimination and calibration.We constructed two risk stratification score systems, named as STPCAL (including significant factors in the prediction model: number of clinical symptoms, the maximum body temperature during hospitalization, platelet count, C-reactive protein, albumin and lactate dehydrogenase) and TRPNCLP (including maximum body temperature during hospitalization, history of respiratory diseases, platelet count, neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio, creatinine, lactate dehydrogenase, and prothrombin time), to predict hospitalization duration for moderate patients and disease progression for severe patients, respectively. According to STPCAL score, moderate patients were classified into three risk categories for a longer hospital duration: low (Score 0-1, median = 8 days, with less than 20.0% probabilities), intermediate (Score 2-6, median = 13 days, with 30.0-78.9% probabilities), high (Score 7-9, median = 19 days, with more than 86.5% probabilities).

During the spring of 2020, the cessation of all elective surgical procedures and the diminished number of outpatient visits challenged graduate medical education. While residency programs in less affected areas may not have had to make many dramatic adjustments, some of those located in pandemic hotspots had to redirect trainees from orthopaedic rotations to COVID-19 units. No matter the region, the time that trainees have spent in rotations has been altered, and absences have occurred due to quarantines. This symposium summarizes the impact of restrictions related to the COVID-19 pandemic on residency and fellowship programs from the perspectives of the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME), a program director, and a graduating resident. Although new opportunities for virtual curricula, virtual surgical simulation, and virtual interviews have been innovated, residency programs and residents report primarily a negative effect from the pandemic due to decreased surgical volumes and the limitation of patient-care experiences. Ultimately, program directors have an obligation to the program, the trainee, and the general public to graduate only those residents and fellows who are truly prepared to practice independently; they have the responsibility of making the final decision regarding graduation. The COVID-19 pandemic has continued to underscore the need for competency-based medical education. Assessing competency includes evaluation of the knowledge, the operative skills, the nonoperative patient-care skills, and the professional behavior of each and every individual graduating from orthopaedic residency and fellowship training programs.

Increasing evidence shows that infection by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) causes a very complex and multifaceted disease that requires detailed study. Nevertheless, experimental research on COVID-19 remains challenging due to the lack of appropriate animal models. Herein, we report novel humanized mice with Cre-dependent expression of hACE2, the main entry receptor of SARS-CoV-2. These mice carry hACE2 and GFP transgenes floxed by the STOP cassette, allowing them to be used as breeders for the creation of animals with tissue-specific coexpression of hACE2 and GFP. Moreover, inducible expression of hACE2 makes this line biosafe, whereas coexpression with GFP simplifies the detection of transgene-expressing cells. In our study, we tested our line by crossing with Ubi-Cre mice, characterized by tamoxifen-dependent ubiquitous activation of Cre recombinase. After tamoxifen administration, the copy number of the STOP cassette was decreased, and the offspring expressed hACE2 and GFP, confirming the efficiency of our system. We believe that our model can be a useful tool for studying COVID-19 pathogenesis because the selective expression of hACE2 can shed light on the roles of different tissues in SARS-CoV-2-associated complications.

Past coronavirus outbreaks caused by SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV inflicted life-threatening acute kidney injuries (AKI) on their hosts leading to significant mortality rates, which went somewhat overlooked in the face of the severe respiratory effects. Recent evidence has emphasized renal involvement in SARS-CoV-2, stressing that kidneys are damaged in COVID-19 patients. The mechanism by which this virus inflicts AKI is still unclear, but evidence from other coronavirus strains may hold some clues. Two theories exist for the proposed mechanism of AKI: 1) the AKI is a secondary effect to reduced blood and oxygen levels causing hyperinflammation and 2) the AKI is due to cytotoxic effects. Kidneys express angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2), the confirmed SARS-CoV-2 target receptor as well as collectrin, an ACE2 homologue, that localizes to the primary cilium, an organelle historically targeted by coronaviruses. While the available literature suggests that kidney damage is leading to higher mortality rates in COVID-19 patients, especially in those with pre-existing kidney and cardiovascular diseases, the pathogenesis of COVID-19 is still being investigated.

After a prolonged period of little to no transmission, there was an outbreak of unknown source in July, 2020, in the Da Nang region, but the outbreak was quickly suppressed. We aimed to use epidemiological, behavioural, demographic, and policy data from the COVID-19 outbreak in Da Nang to calibrate an agent-based model of COVID-19 transmission for Vietnam, and to estimate the risk of future outbreaks associated with reopening of international borders in the country.For this modelling study, we used comprehensive data from June 15 to Oct 15, 2020, on testing, COVID-19 cases, and quarantine breaches within an agent-based model of SARS-CoV-2 transmission to model a COVID-19 outbreak in Da Nang in July, 2020. We applied this model to quantify the risk of future outbreaks in Vietnam in the 3 months after the reopening of international borders, under different behavioural scenarios, policy responses (ie, closure of workplaces and schools), and ongoing testing.We estimated that the outbreak in Da Nang between July and August, 2020, resulted in substantial community transmission, and that higher levels of symptomatic testing could have mitigated this transmission. We estimated that the outbreak peaked on Aug 2, 2020, with an estimated 1060 active infections (95% projection interval 890-1280). If the population of Vietnam remains highly compliant with mask-wearing policies, our projections indicate that the epidemic would remain under control even if a small but steady flow of imported infections escaped quarantine into the community. However, if complacency increases and testing rates are relatively low (10% of symptomatic individuals are tested), the epidemic could rebound again, resulting in an estimated 2100 infections (95% projected interval 1050-3610) in 3 months. These outcomes could be mitigated if the behaviour of the general population responds dynamically to increases in locally acquired cases that exceed specific thresholds, but only if testing of symptomatic individuals is also increased.The successful response to COVID-19 in Vietnam could be improved even further with higher levels of symptomatic testing. If the previous approaches are used in response to new COVID-19 outbreaks, epidemic control is possible even in the presence of low levels of imported cases.Ministry of Science and Technology (Vietnam).For the Vietnamese translation of the abstract see Supplementary Materials section.", "preprint": false}, "144219": {"doi": "10.1371/journal.pntd.0009327", "journal": "PLoS neglected tropical diseases", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33857136/", "date": "2021-04-16", "title": "Deciphering the introduction and transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in the Colombian Amazon Basin.", "subfield": "Mortality", "authors": "Nathalia Ballesteros, Marina MuÃ±oz, Luz Helena PatiÃ±o, Carolina HernÃ¡ndez, Felipe GonzÃ¡lez-Casabianca, IvÃ¡n Carroll, Mauricio Santos-Vega, Jaime Cascante, AndrÃ©s Angel, Alejandro Feged-Rivadeneira, MÃ³nica Palma-Cuero, Carolina FlÃ³rez, Sergio Gomez, Adriana van de Guchte, Zenab Khan, Jayeeta Dutta, Ajay Obla, Hala Alejel Alshammary, Ana S Gonzalez-Reiche, Matthew M Hernandez, Emilia Mia Sordillo, Viviana Simon, Harm van Bakel, Alberto Paniz-M, Juan David RamÃ­r", "abstract": "The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has forced health authorities across the world to take important decisions to curtail its spread.

In the absence of vaccines and effective therapeutical solutions, non-pharmaceutic intervention has become a major way for controlling the epidemic. Gentle mitigation interventions are able to slow down the epidemic but not to halt it well. While strict suppression interventions are efficient for controlling the epidemic, long-term measures are likely to have negative impacts on economics and people's daily live. Hence, dynamically balancing suppression and mitigation interventions plays a fundamental role in manipulating the epidemic curve.We collected data of the number of infections for several countries during the COVID-19 pandemics and found a clear phenomenon of periodic waves of infection. Based on the observation, by connecting the infection level with the medical resources and a tolerance parameter, we propose a mathematical model to understand impacts of combining intervention measures on the epidemic dynamics.Depending on the parameters of the medical resources, tolerance level, and the starting time of interventions, the combined intervention measure dynamically changes with the infection level, resulting in a periodic wave of infections controlled below an accepted level. The study reveals that, (a) with an immediate, strict suppression, the numbers of infections and deaths are well controlled with a significant reduction in a very short time period; (b) an appropriate, dynamical combination of suppression and mitigation may find a feasible way in reducing the impacts of epidemic on people's live and economics.While the assumption of interventions deployed with a cycle of period in the model is limited and unrealistic, the phenomenon of periodic waves of infections in reality is captured by our model. These results provide helpful insights for policy-makers to dynamically deploy an appropriate intervention strategy to effectively battle against the COVID-19.", "preprint": false}, "144507": {"doi": "10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2021.6147", "journal": "JAMA network open", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33856474/", "date": "2021-04-16", "title": "Prescribing of Opioid Analgesics and Buprenorphine for Opioid Use Disorder During the COVID-19 Pandemic.", "subfield": "Treatment", "authors": "Janet M Currie, Molly K Schnell, Hannes Schwandt, Jonathan Zha", "abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic disrupted medical care, impacting prescribing of opioid analgesics and buprenorphine for opioid use disorder.

To develop strategies for reducing anxiety and increasing adherence with health guidelines, it is important to understand the factors that contribute to anxiety and health compliance in the context of COVID-19. Earlier research has shown that greater perceived risk of negative events and their costs are associated with increased anxiety and compliance with health behaviors, but it is unclear what role they play in a novel pandemic surrounded by uncertainty. In the present study we measured (1) perceived risk as the self-reported probability of being infected and experiencing serious symptoms due to COVID-19 and (2) perceived cost as financial, real-world, physical, social, and emotional consequences of being infected with COVID-19. Worry was assessed using the Penn State Worry Questionnaire (PWSQ) and health compliance was measured as endorsement of the World Health Organization (WHO) health directives for COVID-19. Our results showed that greater perceived risk and costs of contracting the COVID-19 virus were associated with greater worry and while only costs were associated with greater compliance with health behaviors. Neither self-reported worry nor its interaction with cost estimates was associated with increased engagement in health behaviors.

Network metrics are computed to identify structural trends which show clear changes based on the timing of stay-at-home orders.

As was demonstrated during Ebola, preparedness is key to limiting a health crisis' spread and impact on health systems and ensuring continued care for vulnerable populations including people living with HIV (PLHIV). To assess COVID-19 preparedness and inform interventions to ensure continuity of HIV services at health facilities (HFs) and community service points (CSPs), we conducted site readiness assessments in Freetown, the epicenter of COVID-19 in Sierra Leone. Data were collected at nine high-volume HIV HFs and seven CSPs in April 2020, a month after COVID-19 was declared a pandemic. CSPs comprised three community drop-in centers providing HIV counseling and testing services as well as HIV prevention services (e.g., condoms and lubricants) for key and priority populations and four community-based support groups serving PLHIV. At the time of assessment, CSPs did not provide antiretroviral therapy (ART) but were considered potential sites for expansion of differentiated service delivery (DSD)-a client-centered approach to HIV care-in the context of COVID-19. Overall, 5/9 HFs had trained staff on use of personal protective equipment (PPE) and prevention of COVID-19 transmission. Most had access to masks (5/9) and gloves (7/9) for management of suspected/confirmed COVID-19 cases, and 4/9 HFs had triage procedures for isolation of suspected cases. Conversely, few CSPs had access to masks (2/7) or gloves (2/7) and no staff were trained on PPE use or COVID-19 transmission. 7/9 HFs had adequate ART stock for multi-month dispensing though few had procedures for (3/9) or had trained staff in providing DSD (2/9). Among CSPs where measures were applicable, 2/4 had procedures for DSD, 1/3 had staff trained on DSD and none had adequate ART stock. Identification of gaps in COVID-19 preparedness is a critical step in providing support for infection control and modified service delivery.

Patterns of media use have also been associated with acceptance of Covid-19 conspiracy beliefs. Here we ask whether the type of media on which a person relies increased, decreased or had no additional effect on that person's Covid-19 conspiracy beliefs over a four-month period.We used panel data to explore whether use of conservative and social media in the US, which were previously found to be positively related to holding conspiracy beliefs about the origins and prevention of Covid-19, were associated with a net increase in the strength of those beliefs from March to July of 2020. We also asked whether mainstream news sources, which were previously found to be negatively related to belief in pandemic-related conspiracies, were associated with a net decrease in the strength of such beliefs over the study period. Additionally, we asked whether subsequent changes in pandemic conspiracy beliefs related to the use of media were also related to subsequent mask wearing and vaccination intentions.A survey that we conducted with a national US probability sample in March of 2020 and again in July with the same 840 respondents assessed belief in pandemic-related conspiracies, use of various types of media information sources, actions taken to prevent the spread of the disease and intentions to vaccinate, and various demographic characteristics.

Importantly, conspiracy belief changes related to media use between the two waves of the study were associated with the uptake of mask wearing and changes in vaccination intentions in July.

We pictured the results of the SARS-CoV-2 invasion to the central nervous system (CNS) via neuronal and hematogenous routes, in addition to viral infection in peripheral tissues with extensive crosstalk with the CNS. SARS-CoV-2 infection results in pro-inflammatory cytokine and chemokine release and activation of the immune system, COVID-19-associated coagulopathy, endotheliitis and vasculitis, hypoxia, imbalance in the renin-angiotensin system, and cardiovascular complications that all may lead to the incidence of stroke.

Especially in the COVID-19 pandemic, molecular techniques and biotechnological innovation have proven to be of utmost importance for rapid developments in disease diagnostics and treatment, including DNA and RNA sequencing technology, treatment with drugs and natural products and vaccine development. The COVID-19 crisis, however, has also demonstrated the need for systemic thinking and transdisciplinarity and the limits of MSM: the neglect of the bio-psycho-social systemic nature of humans and their context as the object of individual therapeutic and population-oriented interventions. COVID-19 illustrates how a medical problem requires a transdisciplinary approach in epidemiology, pathology, internal medicine, public health, environmental medicine, and socio-economic modeling. Regarding the need for conceptual integration of these different kinds of knowledge we suggest the application of general system theory (GST). This approach endorses an organism-centered view on health and disease, which according to Ludwig von Bertalanffy who was the founder of GST, we call Organismal Systems Medicine (OSM). We argue that systems science offers wider applications in the field of pathology and can contribute to an integrative systems medicine by (i) integration of evidence across functional and structural differentially scaled subsystems, (ii) conceptualization of complex multilevel systems, and (iii) suggesting mechanisms and non-linear relationships underlying the observed phenomena. We underline these points with a proposal on multi-level systems pathology including neurophysiology, endocrinology, immune system, genetics, and general metabolism. An integration of these areas is necessary to understand excess mortality rates and polypharmacological treatments. In the pandemic era this multi-level systems pathology is most important to assess potential vaccines, their effectiveness, short-, and long-time adverse effects.

However, the mental health challenges and complexities faced by hospital staff in the United States has not been fully elucidated.

We assessed depression with the Patient Health Questionnaire-9. Anxiety was measured with the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 scale. Logistic regression analyses were calculated to identify associations with depression and anxiety.Of 3,500 hospital employees, 1,246 (36%) responded to the survey. We included 1,232 individuals in the final analysis. Overall, psychological distress was common among the respondents: 21% and 33% of staff reported significant depression and anxiety, respectively, while 46% experienced overwhelming stress due to COVID-19. Notably, staff members overwhelmed by the stress of COVID-19 were seven and nine times more likely to suffer from depression and anxiety, respectively. In addition to stress, individuals with six to nine years of work experience were two times more likely to report moderate or severe depression compared to those with 10 or more years of work experience. Moreover, ancillary staff with direct patient contact (odds ratio [OR] 8.9, confidence interval (CI), 1.46, 173.03) as well as administrative and ancillary staff with indirect patient contact (OR 5.9, CI, 1.06, 111.01) were more likely to be depressed than physicians and advanced providers.We found that a considerable proportion of staff were suffering from psychological distress. COVID-19-associated depression and anxiety was widespread among hospital staff even in settings with comparatively lower COVID-19 hospitalization rates. Ancillary staff, administrative staff, staff with less job experience, and staff overwhelmed by the stress of COVID-19 are particularly susceptible to negative mental health outcomes.

Although initial studies do not suggest an unfavourable course of infection in this group of patients, the data is limited.This study included 396 MS patients treated with DMTs and confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection from 28 Polish MS centres. Information concerning patient demographics, comorbidities, clinical course of MS, current DMT use, as well as symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 infection, need for pharmacotherapy, oxygen therapy, and/or hospitalisation, and short-term outcomes was collected up to 30 January 2021. Additional data about COVID-19 cases in the general population in Poland was obtained from official reports of the Polish Ministry of Health.There were 114 males (28.8%) and 282 females (71.2%). The median age was 39 years (IQR 13). The great majority of patients with MS exhibited relapsing-remitting course (372 patients; 93.9%). The median EDSS was 2 (SD 1.38), and the mean disease duration was 8.95 (IQR 8) years. Most of the MS patients were treated with dimethyl fumarate (164; 41.41%).

There is significant variation in activity, with uptake ranging from 25% to 85% in different areas, and clear evidence of variation in implementation and delivery practice.We aim to understand how the NHS Health Check programme works in different settings, for different groups, so that we can recommend improvements to maximise intended outcomes. To do so, we will undertake a realist review and a survey of LA public health teams. Our review will follow Pawson's five iterative stages: (1) locate existing theories, (2) search for evidence, (3) article selection, (4) extract and organise data and (5) synthesise evidence and draw conclusions. Our review will include documents describing local implementation alongside published research studies. We will recruit a stakeholder group (including Public Health England, commissioners and providers of Health Checks, plus members of the public and patients) to advise us throughout. Our survey will be sent to all 152 LAs in England to gather detailed information on programme delivery (including COVID-19-related changes) and available referral services. This will enable us to map delivery across England and relate these data to programme outcomes.Ethical approval is not required for this review.

Proper PPE and airway management techniques are critical to prevent the transmission of respiratory illnesses such as COVID-19.In March 2020, the authors implemented a structured train-the-trainers curriculum to teach PPE techniques and a modified airway management algorithm for suspected COVID-19 patients. A single emergency medicine physician trainer taught 17 subsequent emergency medicine and critical care physician trainers the proper PPE and airway management techniques. The initial trainer and 7 of the subsequent trainers then instructed 99 other emergency medicine resident and attending physicians using in situ simulation. Trainers and learners completed retrospective pre-post surveys to assess their comfort teaching the material and performing the techniques, respectively.The surveys demonstrated a significant increase in the trainers' comfort in teaching simulation-based education, from 4.00 to 4.53 on a 5-point Likert scale (P < .005), and in teaching the airway management techniques through simulation, from 2.47 to 4.47 (P < .001).

Thirteen ward managers from a Danish university hospital were included and interviewed using telephone interviews three months after the first national COVID-19 case was confirmed.The main findings of the study revealed that the ward managers often experienced a lack of timely, relevant information, involvement in decision-making and acknowledgement from the head nurse of department and the executive management.

Consequently, COVID-19 has become an important factor influencing adolescents' mental health. The purpose of this study is to explore the intervention effect of the integration model on the negative emotions of adolescents during the COVID-19 epidemic.Adolescents were randomly selected from five middle schools in Zhejiang Province of China from May 2020 to July 2020. First, the Self-rating Anxiety Scale, Positive and Negative Affect Scale, and Psychological Well-Being Scale were used for measurement. Then, 72 patients with moderate and severe anxiety symptoms were chosen as the research objects, and the intervention and comparison time was determined to be eight weeks. The subjects were randomly divided into the experiment group (35 members) and the control group (34 members). The integration model was employed on the experiment group.Grade, physical condition, and sleep time are important factors influencing the anxiety level of adolescents during the COVID-19 period, and the anxiety risk of adolescents is higher during their third year of junior high school. After the intervention, the SAS score of the experiment group is lower than that of the control group, and the decrease in the SAS score is higher in the experiment group than in the control group (P<0.01). Moreover, the positive emotion score of the experiment group is higher than that of the control group, and the negative emotion score of the former is lower than that of the latter. The variances in the positive and negative emotion scores are higher in the experiment group than in the control group (P<0.01). The variance in the overall well-being index is also greater in the experiment group than in the control group (P<0.01).The intervention using the integrated model can significantly reduce negative emotions such as anxiety, increase positive emotions, and improve the overall well-being of adolescents during the epidemic period.", "preprint": false}, "144249": {"doi": "10.1136/bmj.n978", "journal": "BMJ (Clinical research ed.)", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33853766/", "date": "2021-04-16", "title": "Covid-19: India authorises Sputnik V vaccine as cases soar to more than 180 000 a day.", "subfield": "Mortality", "authors": "Patralekha Chatterj", "abstract": "", "preprint": false}, "144234": {"doi": "10.1016/j.watres.2021.117104", "journal": "Water research", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33857895/", "date": "2021-04-16", "title": "Rapid screening for SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern in clinical and environmental samples using nested RT-PCR assays targeting key mutations of the spike protein.", "subfield": "Testing", "authors": "G La Rosa, P Mancini, G Bonanno Ferraro, C Veneri, M Iaconelli, L Lucentini, L Bonadonna, S Brusaferro, D Brandtner, A Fasanella, L Pace, A Parisi, D Galante, E Suffredi", "abstract": "New SARS-CoV-2 mutations are constantly emerging, raising concerns of increased transmissibility, virulence or escape from host immune response. We describe a nested RT-PCR assay (~1500Â bps) to detect multiple nucleotide changes resulting in key spike protein mutations distinctive of the major known circulating SARS-CoV-2 variants, including the three Variants of Concern (VOCs) 20I/501Y.V1 (United Kingdom), 20H/501Y.V2 (South Africa), and 20Â J/501Y.V3 (Brazil), as well as the 20E.EU1 variant (Spain), the CAL.20C recently identified in California, and the mink-associated variant (GR, lineage B.1.1.298). Prior to application to field samples, the discriminatory potential of this PCR assay was explored using GISAID and Nextclade. To extend variant detection to challenging matrices such as sewage, where the amplification of long fragments is problematic, two short nested RT-PCR assays (~300Â bps) were also designed, targeting portions of the region spanned by the long nested assay. The three newly-designed assays were then tested on field samples, including 31 clinical samples (7 fully-sequenced swab samples, and 24 uncharacterized ones) and 34 urban wastewater samples, some of which collected in areas where circulation of VOCs had been reported. The long assay successfully amplified 29 of the 31 swabs (93%), allowing the correct identification of variants 20I/501Y.V1 and 20E.EU1 present in the panel of previously characterized samples. The Spanish variant was detected in 14/24 of the uncharacterized samples as well. The sequences obtained using the short assays were consistent with those obtained with the long assay. Mutations characteristic of VOCs (UK and Brazilian variant) and of other variant (Spanish) were detected in sewage samples. To our knowledge, this is the first evidence of the presence of sequences harboring key mutations of 20I/501Y.V1 and 20Â J/501Y.V3 in urban wastewaters, highlighting the potential contribution of wastewater surveillance to explore SARS-CoV-2 diversity. The developed nested RT-PCR assays can be used as an initial rapid screening test to select clinical samples containing mutations of interest. This can speed up diagnosis and optimize resources since it allows full genome sequencing to be done only on clinically relevant specimens. The assays can be also employed for a rapid and cost-effective detection of VOCs or other variants in sewage for the purposes of wastewater-based epidemiology. The approach proposed here can be used to better understand SARS-CoV-2 variant diversity, geographic distribution and impact worldwide.", "preprint": false}, "144228": {"doi": "10.2196/29603", "journal": "JMIR public health and surveillance", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33857010/", "date": "2021-04-16", "title": "Correction: Assessment of the Effectiveness of Identity-Based Public Health Announcements in Increasing the Likelihood of Complying With COVID-19 Guidelines: Randomized Controlled Cross-sectional Web-Based Study.", "subfield": "Epidemiology", "authors": "Alexander S Dennis, Patricia L Moravec, Antino Kim, Alan R Denn", "abstract": "[This corrects the article DOI: .].", "preprint": false}, "144539": {"doi": "10.1186/s12871-021-01310-z\n10.1111/anae.15063\n10.1177/0194599819878699\n10.1186/s12891-019-2963-8\n10.1007/s00405-018-5117-y\n10.1007/s10068-017-0134-y\n10.1016/j.watres.2009.09.032\n10.1056/NEJMc2004973\n10.1111/anae.15054\n10.1080/02786820701455351\n10.2105/AJPH.57.12.2186\n10.1002/adhm.201300641\n10.1093/bja/aei091\n10.1016/j.compscitech.2013.11.005\n10.1016/j.bej.2019.107254", "journal": "BMC anesthesiology", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33853526/", "date": "2021-04-16", "title": "Development and validation of a 3D printed antiviral ventilator filter - a comparative study.", "subfield": "Epidemiology", "authors": "Ruth Shaylor, Mathew Francis, Esther Shaylor, Solomon Dadia, Barak Coh", "abstract": "The current coronavirus infectious disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has caused unexpected pressure on medical supplies, interrupting supply chains and increasing prices.

We present the clinical, neuropathological, and molecular findings of 41 consecutive patients with SARS-CoV-2 infections who died and underwent autopsy in our medical center. The mean age was 74âyears (38-97âyears), 27 patients (66%) were male and 34 (83%) were of Hispanic/Latinx ethnicity. Twenty-four patients (59%) were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). Hospital-associated complications were common, including 8 (20%) with deep vein thrombosis/pulmonary embolism (DVT/PE), 7 (17%) patients with acute kidney injury requiring dialysis, and 10 (24%) with positive blood cultures during admission. Eight (20%) patients died within 24âhours of hospital admission, while 11 (27%) died more than 4âweeks after hospital admission. Neuropathological examination of 20-30 areas from each brain revealed hypoxic/ischemic changes in all brains, both global and focal; large and small infarcts, many of which appeared hemorrhagic; and microglial activation with microglial nodules accompanied by neuronophagia, most prominently in the brainstem. We observed sparse T lymphocyte accumulation in either perivascular regions or in the brain parenchyma. Many brains contained atherosclerosis of large arteries and arteriolosclerosis, though none had evidence of vasculitis. Eighteen (44%) contained pathologies of neurodegenerative diseases, not unexpected given the age range of our patients. We examined multiple fresh frozen and fixed tissues from 28 brains for the presence of viral RNA and protein, using quantitative reverse-transcriptase PCR (qRT-PCR), RNAscope, and immunocytochemistry with primers, probes, and antibodies directed against the spike and nucleocapsid regions. qRT-PCR revealed low to very low, but detectable, viral RNA levels in the majority of brains, although they were far lower than those in nasal epithelia. RNAscope and immunocytochemistry failed to detect viral RNA or protein in brains. Our findings indicate that the levels of detectable virus in COVID-19 brains are very low and do not correlate with the histopathological alterations. These findings suggest that microglial activation, microglial nodules and neuronophagia, observed in the majority of brains, do not result from direct viral infection of brain parenchyma, but rather likely from systemic inflammation, perhaps with synergistic contribution from hypoxia/ischemia. Further studies are needed to define whether these pathologies, if present in patients who survive COVID-19, might contribute to chronic neurological problems.", "preprint": false}, "144222": {"doi": "10.3389/fphar.2021.603736", "journal": "Frontiers in pharmacology", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33854432/", "date": "2021-04-16", "title": "Angiotensin Receptor Blockers for COVID-19: Pathophysiological and Pharmacological Considerations About Ongoing and Future Prospective Clinical Trials.", "subfield": "Infection", "authors": "Rodolfo Pedro Rothlin, Mariano Duarte, Facundo GermÃ¡n Pelorosso, Liliana Nicolosi, M Victoria Salgado, HÃ©ctor Miguel Vetulli, Eduardo Spitz", "abstract": "COVID-19 pandemic demands a swift response to find therapeutic tools that effectively reduce morbidity and mortality.

Intriguingly, the human fetus is largely spared from SARS-CoV-2 infection. We tested whether the human placenta expresses the main SARS-CoV-2 entry factors angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2), and furin and showed that ACE2 and TMPRSS2 are expressed in the trophoblast rather than in other placental villous cells.

In particular, TBI caregivers may face specific challenges when assisting their patients in handling unexpected changes to their daily routines. Therefore, this quantitative study aims to explore the needs of caregivers, their coping mechanisms towards stressful and traumatic circumstances, and how they provide care to their loved ones during the COVID-19 pandemic.It was conducted with ten caregivers of individuals suffering from traumatic brain injury, that were selected using a theoretical sampling method. Data were obtained using a semi-structured interview guide, which helped the caregivers provide their responses. Meanwhile, data analysis was performed using the NVIVO analysis software.The results showed that there were, three significant themes namely, (a) Support needed, (b) the information need for care, and (c) developing self-resilience. The results also showed that caregivers really need support from the various parties, and the participants lack information on specific care techniques for the severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) survivors.In conclusion, caregivers require approval and seek more useful information to provide excellent care to their loved ones.

Urgent and careful planning is needed to mitigate negative effects of pandemic on engineering education that has been traditionally content-centered, hands-on and design-oriented. To enhance engineering online education during the pandemic, we conducted an observational study at California State University, Long Beach (one of the largest and most diverse four-year university in the U.S.). A total of 110 faculty members and 627 students from six engineering departments participated in surveys and answered quantitative and qualitative questions to highlight the challenges they experienced during the online instruction in Spring 2020. Our results identified various issues that negatively influenced the online engineering education including logistical/technical problems, learning/teaching challenges, privacy and security concerns and lack of sufficient hands-on training. For example, more than half of the students indicated lack of engagement in class, difficulty in maintaining their focus and Zoom fatigue after attending multiple online sessions. A correlation analysis showed that while semi-online asynchronous exams were associated with an increase in the perceived cheating by the instructors, a fully online or open-book/open-note exams had an association with a decrease in instructor's perception of cheating. To address various identified challenges, we recommended strategies for educational stakeholders (students, faculty and administration) to fill the tools and technology gap and improve online engineering education. These recommendations are practical approaches for many similar institutions around the world and would help improve the learning outcomes of online educations in various engineering subfields.

The virus surface spike protein of SARS CoV-2 mediates viral entry into cells by binding to the ACE2 receptor on epithelial cells and promoting fusion. We find that Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) induces ACE2 expression when it enters the lytic replicative cycle in epithelial cells. By using VSV particles pseudotyped with the SARS CoV-2 spike protein, we show that lytic EBV replication enhances ACE2-dependent SARS CoV-2 pseudovirus entry. We find that the ACE2 promoter contains response elements for Zta, an EBV transcriptional activator that is essential for EBV entry into the lytic cycle of replication. Zta preferentially acts on methylated promoters, allowing it to reactivate epigenetically silenced EBV promoters from latency. By using promoter assays, we show that Zta directly activates methylated ACE2 promoters. Infection of normal oral keratinocytes with EBV leads to lytic replication in some of the infected cells, induces ACE2 expression and enhances SARS CoV-2 pseudovirus entry. These data suggest that subclinical EBV replication and lytic gene expression in epithelial cells, which is ubiquitous in the human population, may enhance the efficiency and extent of SARS CoV-2 infection of epithelial cells by transcriptionally activating ACE2 and increasing its cell surface expression.", "preprint": false}, "144315": {"doi": "10.15585/mmwr.mm7015e2", "journal": "MMWR.

This paper provides a preliminary overview of possible strategies and interventions to tackle these ambiguities. The existing recommendations for protection against heat-related illnesses need revisions to determine whether they include essential aspects of infection control and occupational safety and how they may be supplemented.", "preprint": false}, "144536": {"doi": "10.1177/2632010X211006096", "journal": "Clinical pathology (Thousand Oaks, Ventura County, Calif.)", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33855294/", "date": "2021-04-16", "title": "Possible Involvement of Central Nervous System in COVID-19 and Sequence Variability of SARS-CoV-2 Revealed in Autopsy Tissue Samples: A Case Report.", "subfield": "Symptoms", "authors": "Lis HÃ¸y Marbjerg, Christina Jacobsen, Jannik Fonager, Claus BÃ¸gelund, Morten Rasmussen, Anders Fomsgaard, Jytte Banner, Veronika Vorobieva Solholm Jens", "abstract": "The case presented here illustrates that interdisciplinary teamwork can be essential for the understanding of the COVID-19 disease presentation and enlightening of the pathophysiology.

The spectrum of asymptomatic, presymptomatic, and symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 transmission presents challenges for evaluating SARS-CoV-2 test performance for diagnostic or screening purposes and for interpreting test results. Molecular and antigen tests can detect current SARS-CoV-2 infection and are used to diagnose COVID-19. Clinicians should consider a test's characteristics, test timing in relation to symptom onset, and the pretest probability of disease when interpreting results. Molecular and antigen SARS-CoV-2 tests both have high specificity. However, antigen tests generally have lower sensitivity and thus greater potential for false-negative results. Pretest probability of disease should be based on a patient's exposure to someone with a confirmed or probable case, signs or symptoms of COVID-19, local or population-specific COVID-19 prevalence, and presence of an alternative diagnosis. Using a leaf plot is an efficient way to visualize posttest probability of disease based on estimated pretest probability and the test's sensitivity and specificity. A negative molecular or antigen test result might not rule out SARS-CoV-2 infection when pretest probability is high, depending on the test's sensitivity. A symptom-based approach is preferred over a test-based approach for discontinuing isolation precautions for most patients with COVID-19 because prolonged shedding of viral RNA does not necessarily correlate with infectivity. Antibody tests might help identify past SARS-CoV-2 infection if performed two to four weeks after symptom onset; however, because of uncertainty about the extent and durability of postinfection or vaccine-induced immunity, they should not yet be used to infer immunity or guide discontinuation of personal protective measures.", "preprint": false}, "144311": {"doi": "10.4081/jphr.2021.2145", "journal": "Journal of public health research", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33855390/", "date": "2021-04-16", "title": "Developing the hypoglycemia-nursing early warning score system (Hy-NEWSS): A pilot study.", "subfield": "Clinical Studies", "authors": "Ahmad Hasyim Wibisono, Dennti Kurniasih, Eti Sumartiyah, Rima Novia Putri, Dikha Ayu Kurnia, Yunisar Gultom, Debie Dahl", "abstract": "Severe hypoglycemia occurs in 6% of type 2 DM patients with a 6 to 7% mortality rate.

We included original clinical studies that examined the performance of nasopharyngeal swabs and any additional respiratory specimens for the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection among individuals presenting in ambulatory care. Studies without data on paired samples, or those that only examined different samples from confirmed SARS-CoV-2 cases were not useful for examining diagnostic performance of a test and were excluded. Diagnostic performance, including sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value, was examined using random effects models and double arcsine transformation.Of the 5577 studies identified in our search, 23 studies including 7973 participants with 16â762 respiratory samples were included. Respiratory specimens examined in these studies included 7973 nasopharyngeal swabs, 1622 nasal swabs, 6110 saliva samples, 338 throat swabs, and 719 pooled nasal and throat swabs. Using nasopharyngeal swabs as the gold standard, pooled nasal and throat swabs gave the highest sensitivity of 97% (95% CI 93-100), whereas lower sensitivities were achieved by saliva (85%, 75-93) and nasal swabs (86%, 77-93) and a much lower sensitivity by throat swabs (68%, 35-94). A comparably high positive predictive value was obtained by pooled nasal and throat (97%, 90-100) and nasal swabs (96%, 87-100) and a slightly lower positive predictive value by saliva (93%, 88-97). Throat swabs have the lowest positive predictive value of 75% (95% CI 45-96). Comparably high specificities (range 97-99%) and negative predictive value (range 95-99%) were observed among different clinical specimens. Comparison between health-care-worker collection and self-collection for pooled nasal and throat swabs and nasal swabs showed comparable diagnostic performance. No significant heterogeneity was observed in the analysis of pooled nasal and throat swabs and throat swabs, whereas moderate to substantial heterogeneity (IOur review suggests that, compared with the gold standard of nasopharyngeal swabs, pooled nasal and throat swabs offered the best diagnostic performance of the alternative sampling approaches for diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection in ambulatory care. Saliva and nasal swabs gave comparable and very good diagnostic performance and are clinically acceptable alternative specimen collection methods. Throat swabs gave a much lower sensitivity and positive predictive value and should not be recommended. Self-collection for pooled nasal and throat swabs and nasal swabs was not associated with any significant impairment of diagnostic accuracy.

Understanding the relationships between health-system preparedness, responses to COVID-19, and the pattern of spread of the epidemic is particularly important in a country marked by wide inequalities in socioeconomic characteristics (eg, housing and employment status) and other health risks (age structure and burden of chronic disease).From several publicly available sources in Brazil, we obtained data on health risk factors for severe COVID-19 (proportion of the population with chronic disease and proportion aged â¥60 years), socioeconomic vulnerability (proportions of the population with housing vulnerability or without formal work), health-system capacity (numbers of intensive care unit beds and physicians), coverage of health and social assistance, deaths from COVID-19, and state-level responses of government in terms of physical distancing policies. We also obtained data on the proportion of the population staying at home, based on locational data, as a measure of physical distancing adherence. We developed a socioeconomic vulnerability index (SVI) based on household characteristics and the Human Development Index. Data were analysed at the state and municipal levels. Descriptive statistics and correlations between state-level indicators were used to characterise the relationship between the availability of health-care resources and socioeconomic characteristics and the spread of the epidemic and the response of governments and populations in terms of new investments, legislation, and physical distancing. We used linear regressions on a municipality-by-month dataset from February to October, 2020, to characterise the dynamics of COVID-19 deaths and response to the epidemic across municipalities.The initial spread of COVID-19 was mostly affected by patterns of socioeconomic vulnerability as measured by the SVI rather than population age structure and prevalence of health risk factors. The states with a high (greater than median) SVI were able to expand hospital capacity, to enact stringent COVID-19-related legislation, and to increase physical distancing adherence in the population, although not sufficiently to prevent higher COVID-19 mortality during the initial phase of the epidemic compared with states with a low SVI. Death rates accelerated until June, 2020, particularly in municipalities with the highest socioeconomic vulnerability. Throughout the following months, however, differences in policy response converged in municipalities with lower and higher SVIs, while physical distancing remained relatively higher and death rates became relatively lower in the municipalities with the highest SVIs compared with those with lower SVIs.In Brazil, existing socioeconomic inequalities, rather than age, health status, and other risk factors for COVID-19, have affected the course of the epidemic, with a disproportionate adverse burden on states and municipalities with high socioeconomic vulnerability. Local government responses and population behaviour in the states and municipalities with higher socioeconomic vulnerability have helped to contain the effects of the epidemic. Targeted policies and actions are needed to protect those with the greatest socioeconomic vulnerability. This experience could be relevant in other low-income and middle-income countries where socioeconomic vulnerability varies greatly.None.For the Portuguese translation of the abstract see Supplementary Materials section.", "preprint": false}, "144420": {"doi": "10.21769/BioProtoc.3964", "journal": "Bio-protocol", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33855122/", "date": "2021-04-16", "title": "Colorimetric RT-LAMP and LAMP-sequencing forDetecting SARS-CoV-2 RNA in Clinical Samples.", "subfield": "Testing", "authors": "Konrad Herbst, Matthias Meurer, Daniel Kirrmaier, Simon Anders, Michael Knop, Viet Loan Dao T", "abstract": "During pandemics, such as the one caused by SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus, simple methods to rapidly test large numbers of people are needed.

Valid near-term projections of cases are required to inform the escalation, maintenance and de-escalation of public health measures, and for short-term health care resource planning.Near-term case and epidemic growth rate projections for Canada were estimated using three phenomenological models: the logistic model, Generalized Richard's model (GRM) and a modified Incidence Decay and Exponential Adjustment (m-IDEA) model. Throughout the COVID-19 epidemic in Canada, these models have been validated against official national epidemiological data on an ongoing basis.The best-fit models estimated that the number of COVID-19 cases predicted to be reported in Canada as of April 1, 2020 and May 1, 2020 would be 11,156 (90 % prediction interval: 9,156-13,905) and 54,745 (90 % prediction interval: 54,252-55,239). The three models varied in their projections and their performance over the first seven weeks of their implementation. Both the logistic model and GRM under-predicted cases reported a week following the projection date in nearly all instances. The logistic model performed best at the early stages, the m-IDEA model performed best at the later stages, and the GRM performed most consistently during the full period assessed.All three models have yielded qualitatively comparable near-term forecasts of cases and epidemic growth for Canada.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the changes and determinants of vaccine acceptance among citizens and non-citizens, over time during the pandemic in Kuwait.Data were obtained from the COVID-19 Snapshot Monitoring (COSMO Kuwait) study that was implemented according to the WHO tool for behavioral insights on COVID-19. Data was collected online, every two weeks throughout the pandemic. Individuals living in Kuwait during the pandemic were surveyed, representing an independent sample of the population during each data collection wave.A total of 7241 adults living in Kuwait participated. Sixty-seven percent of those participating agreed to take a vaccine if it was available and recommended. However, the proportion of vaccine acceptance drastically dropped overtime as COVID-19 related restrictions were eased, among citizens (73 to 47%) and noncitizens (80 to 60%). Some factors associated with increased odds of agreeing to take the COVID-19 vaccine, among citizens and non-citizens, included increased frequency of informing oneself about the virus (OR, 1.34-1.83; 95% confidence interval 1.16-2.55), having high versus low confidence in doctors (OR, 1.79-2.11; CI 1.17-3.80), increased agreement with containment policies (OR, 1.11-1.27; CI 1.05-1.41), expressing more fears and worries (OR, 1.05-1.12; 1.01-1.24), and the increased perceived likelihood of getting infected with influenza (OR, 1.3-1.4; CI 1.03-1.84).

Wounds can be a source of infection by allowing unconstrained entry of microorganisms into the body, including antimicrobial-resistant bacteria. The development of new antimicrobials (particularly antibiotics) is not keeping pace with the evolution of resistant microorganisms and novel ways of addressing this problem are urgently required. One such initiative has been the development of antimicrobial stewardship (AMS) programmes, which educate healthcare workers, and control the prescribing and targeting of antimicrobials to reduce the likelihood of AMR. Of great importance has been the European Wound Management Association (EWMA) in supporting AMS by providing practical recommendations for optimising antimicrobial therapy for the treatment of wound infection. The use of wound dressings that use a physical sequestration and retention approach rather than antimicrobial agents to reduce bacterial burden offers a novel approach that supports AMS. Bacterial-binding by dressings and their physical removal, rather than active killing, minimises their damage and hence prevents the release of damaging endotoxins.Our objective is to highlight AMS for the promotion of the judicious use of antimicrobials and to investigate how dialkylcarbamoyl chloride (DACC)-coated dressings can support AMS goals.MEDLINE, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and Google Scholar were searched to identify published articles describing data relating to AMS, and the use of a variety of wound dressings in the prevention and/or treatment of wound infections. The evidence supporting alternative wound dressings that can reduce bioburden and prevent and/or treat wound infection in a manner that does not kill or damage the microorganisms (for example, by actively binding and removing intact microorganisms from wounds) were then narratively reviewed.The evidence reviewed here demonstrates that using bacterial-binding wound dressings that act in a physical manner (for example, DACC-coated dressings) as an alternative approach to preventing and/or treating infection in both acute and hard-to-heal wounds does not exacerbate AMR and supports AMS.Some wound dressings work via a mechanism that promotes the binding and physical uptake, sequestration and removal of intact microorganisms from the wound bed (for example, a wound dressing that uses DACC technology to successfully prevent/reduce infection). They provide a valuable tool that aligns with the requirements of AMS (for example, reducing the use of antimicrobials in wound treatment regimens) by effectively reducing wound bioburden without inducing/selecting for resistant bacteria.", "preprint": false}, "144280": {"doi": "10.1515/cclm-2021-0313", "journal": "Clinical chemistry and laboratory medicine", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33855843/", "date": "2021-04-16", "title": "Analytical and clinical performances of a SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD IgG assay: comparison with neutralization titers.", "subfield": "Testing", "authors": "Andrea Padoan, Francesco Bonfante, Chiara Cosma, Costanza Di Chiara, Laura Sciacovelli, Matteo Pagliari, Alessio Bortolami, Paola Costenaro, Giulia Musso, Daniela Basso, Carlo Giaquinto, Mario Pleba", "abstract": "SARS-CoV-2 serology presents an important role in several aspects of COVID-19 pandemic.

The review is based on the online data collected about the insurgence in the percentage of elderly people using such platforms, recent studies analyzing the effects of the COVID 19 pandemic on senior citizens. Besides this personal telephonic discussions were conducted with some elderly people who spent their lockdown alone in their homes. The study was primarily focused on three objectives. Firstly it attempts to understand the ways in which senior citizens made use of social networking sites and various digital platforms for managing life better. Secondly, it analyses the process of adopting technology, and finally, it examined the width and depth of the impact technology created in their life and also the permanence of this change.

The comparator was the number of patients newly diagnosed with breast cancer during 2017, 2018, and 2019. The outcome was the change in number of newly diagnosed breast cancer cases.The average monthly percent change after the initial lockdown measures were introduced was -11.0% (95% confidence intervalÂ -Â 22.0% to 1.5%), resulting in a 24% reduction of the newly diagnosed breast cancer cases in Croatia during April, May, and June compared with the same period of 2019. However, during 2020, only 1% fewer new cases were detected than in 2019, or 6% fewer than what would be expected based on the linear trend during 2017-2019.It seems that national health care system measures for controlling the spread of COVID-19 had a detrimental effect on the number of newly diagnosed breast cancer cases in Croatia during the first lockdown. As it is not plausible to expect an epidemiological change to occur at the same time, this may result in later diagnosis, later initiation of treatment, and less favorable outcomes in the future. However, the effect weakened after the first lockdown and COVID-19 control measures were relaxed, and it has not reoccurred during the second COVID-19 wave. Although the COVID-19 lockdown affected the number of newly diagnosed breast cancers, the oncology health care system has shown resilience and compensated for these effects by the end of 2020.It is possible to compensate for the adverse effects of COVID-19 pandemic control measures on breast cancer diagnosis relatively promptly, and it is of crucial importance to do it as soon as possible.

This is further exacerbated by it not being delivered at the point of care, leading to rising cases and deaths. Increases in COVID-19 cases and deaths in the United Kingdom despite performing the highest number of tests in Europe suggest that symptom-based testing and contact tracing might not be effective as a control strategy. An alternative strategy is making testing available to all.The primary objective of this review was to compare mass testing and contact tracing with the conventional test and trace method in the suppression of SARS-CoV-2 infections.

To estimate epidemic parameters, the model was first calibrated to the observed epidemic curve in Wuhan from Jan 23 to Mar 19, 2020. Following the calibration, the infected compartment was replaced by three severity-defined health states to reflect differential costs and quality of life associated with disease gravity. Costs and quality-adjusted life year (QALY) outcomes of nine million simulated people were accrued across time to evaluate the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of remdesivir.

MATERIAL AND METHODS Seventy-four patients with COVID-19 were prospectively followed for longitudinal assessment of somatic symptom burden and sleep quality. We used the 8-item Somatic Symptom Scale (SSS-8) and the modified Medical Research Council (mMRC) scale for somatic symptom burden and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index for sleep quality investigation. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to identify independent factors associated with somatic symptom burden and sleep quality. RESULTS Although the degree of physical discomfort and sleep quality issues tended to decline during self-quarantine, patients still experienced these problems to a certain degree. Univariate and multivariate analyses showed that SSS-8 scores at admission (relative risk [RR] 1.234, 95% CI 1.075-1.417, P=0.003) and mMRC scores at discharge (RR 2.420, 95% CI 1.251-4.682, P=0.009) were 2 independent prognostic indicators of somatic symptom burden. In addition, muscle pain as a chief complaint (RR 4.682, 95% CI 1.247-17.580, P<0.022) and history of use of hypnotic drugs (RR 0.148, 95% CI 0.029-0.749, P<0.019) were 2 independent indicators of patient sleep quality during hospitalization. CONCLUSIONS To the best of our knowledge, the present study was the first dynamic assessment of the somatic symptom burden and sleep quality in patients with COVID-19 during hospitalization and quarantine after discharge.

Emergency releases have been shown to be feasible in terms of public safety but lack sustainability in reducing the number of people living in detention, and, globally, only a small proportion of them have been released. Without controlling the infection inside prisons, global efforts to tackle the spread of the disease may fail. People living in detention are not only more vulnerable to infection with COVID-19 but they are also especially vulnerable to human rights violations induced by inappropriate restrictions under the pretext of infection control. Therefore, alternatives for detention should be promoted and the number of incarcerated people radically decreased.This article calls on policymakers and all professionals involved in public health and criminal justice not to waste the opportunities provided by the crisis but to act now.

Lack of specific and effective therapeutics for the treatment of COVID-19 is a major concern and the development of vaccines is another important aspect in managing the infection effectively. The first step in the SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis is the viral entry and it is mediated by its densely glycosylated spike protein (S-protein). Similar to the SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 also engages angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as the host cell entry receptor. In addition to ACE2, several recent studies have implicated the crucial role cell surface heparan sulfate (HS) as a necessary assisting co-factor for ACE2-mediated SARS-CoV-2 entry. Furthermore, SARS-CoV-2 was also identified to use both endosomal cysteine proteases cathepsin B and L (CatB/L) and the transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2) for the pivotal role of S-protein priming mediating viral entry. As the entry of SARS-CoV-2 into host cells is mandatory for viral infection, it becomes an extremely attractive therapeutic intervention point. In this regard, this review will focus on the therapeutic targeting of the crucial steps of SARS-CoV-2 viral entry like S-protein/ACE2 interaction and S-protein priming by host cell proteases. In addition, this review will also give insights to the readers on several therapeutic opportunities, pharmacological targeting of the viral-entry facilitators like S-Protein, ACE2, cell surface HS, TMPRSS2, and CatB/L and evidence for those drugs currently ongoing clinical studies.

These findings remained qualitatively unaffected by additional adjustment for the use of 17 preventative measures (eg, social distancing, wearing masks and handwashing) and fear against the COVID-19 infection.The participation of the government subsidy programme for domestic travel was associated with a higher probability of exhibiting symptoms indicative of the COVID-19 infection.", "preprint": false}, "143929": {"doi": "10.1007/s11356-021-13639-6\n10.24869/psyd.2020.472\n10.1016/j.enpol.2020.112087\n10.3934/energy.2021003\n10.1177/0734242X09103191\n10.1016/j.spc.2020.10.006\n10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.142228\n10.1007/s11869-020-00855-1\n10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.122729\n10.1007/s10668-019-00416-2\n10.1007/s11356-018-3331-1\n10.1016/j.renene.2018.05.043\n10.1007/s11356-019-07457-0\n10.1016/j.rser.2018.03.035\n10.1007/s11356-020-08836-8\n10.2307/2297968\n10.3390/ijerph16245115\n10.1016/j.qref.2018.11.009\n10.1080/1350485042000203788\n10.1016/j.ecolecon.2020.106755\n10.1007/s11356-020-11516-2\n10.1016/j.rser.2016.12.109\n10.1007/s11356-019-07253-w\n10.1007/s11356-018-3457-1\n10.1016/j.rser.2015.10.080\n10.1080/07350015.1987.10509611\n10.1016/j.gaceta.2018.01.006\n10.1111/j.1467-9574.2005.00299.x\n10.2307/1911963\n10.1016/j.healthpol.2019.12.008\n10.1016/j.cjca.2013.07.765\n10.15171/IJHPM.2017.83\n10.1016/j.frl.2019.04.029\n10.1016/j.envres.2017.05.041\n10.1016/j.scs.2016.02.001\n10.1016/j.renene.2019.01.010\n10.1016/j.ribaf.2020.101331\n10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.121575\n10.1016/j.cities.2012.06.013\n10.1016/j.healthpol.2007.04.004\n10.1016/j.jclepro.2019.118537\n10.1016/S0140-6736(16)30167-2\n10.1016/j.ecolecon.2004.02.011\n10.1007/s11356-020-07878-2\n10.1016/j.rser.2016.02.006\n10.1016/j.jval.2016.08.621\n10.1016/j.socscimed.2014.01.014\n10.1007/s11356-019-04779-x\n10.1177/1524839910364381\n10.1016/j.jspi.2010.05.008\n10.2307/2118443\n10.3386/w3914\n10.1038/jhh.2011.79\n10.1016/j.enpol.2008.11.012\n10.1016/j.ecolecon.2013.04.002\n10.2307/1912775\n10.1016/j.jclepro.2019.06.121\n10.1016/S0304-4076(03)00092-7\n10.2307/2971718\n10.1016/j.renene.2018.02.041\n10.1007/s11356-019-06276-7\n10.1002/hpm.2629\n10.1016/j.enpol.2011.12.010\n10.14419/ijasp.v3i2.4686\n10.1080/07474938.2013.806708\n10.1111/1468-0084.0610s1691\n10.1007/s11869-019-00778-6\n10.1080/09640568.2019.1692796\n10.1002/sd.1958\n10.1016/j.rser.2016.04.061\n10.1002/sd.2034\n10.1016/j.egypro.2015.07.652\n10.2307/1913643\n10.1257/jep.15.4.143\n10.1007/s11356-020-09172-7\n10.1016/j.jclepro.2019.118872\n10.1016/S0304-4076(01)00098-7\n10.1016/j.spc.2020.11.008\n10.1080/1540496X.2018.1439375\n10.1016/S0140-6736(16)00343-3\n10.3390/su12083480\n10.1007/s11356-020-11976-6\n10.3390/su12208341\n10.1016/j.econmod.2016.07.001\n10.1016/j.ecolecon.2007.07.005\n10.1016/j.wasman.2008.08.031\n10.1016/j.neuroimage.2020.116938\n10.1016/j.jclepro.2018.03.236\n10.1016/j.energy.2020.119220\n10.1111/1468-0084.0610s1653\n10.1162/003465301753237803\n10.15244/pjoes/102369\n10.1016/j.jeconom.2007.05.010\n10.1016/j.ecolind.2019.105699\n10.1007/s11356-015-4440-8\n10.1016/j.strueco.2021.01.006\n10.1016/j.envdev.2015.12.001\n10.1007/s11356-019-05188-w\n10.1289/ehp.109-1240667\n10.1136/bmj.331.7526.1157\n10.1016/j.enpol.2013.10.064\n10.1016/j.energy.2020.117956\n10.1016/j.wasman.2008.08.025\n10.1007/s11869-020-00833-7\n10.1016/j.enpol.2020.111660\n10.1016/j.bbih.2020.100159\n10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.121669\n10.1016/j.hlpt.2020.01.006\n10.1016/j.jclepro.2018.03.191\n10.3389/fpubh.2019.00324\n10.1007/s11356-019-04876-x\n10.1016/j.jeconom.2004.02.005\n10.1016/j.energy.2020.118159\n10.3390/ijerph16152748\n10.1186/s40064-016-2505-x\n10.1080/20954816.2016.1218670\n10.1016/j.scs.2018.04.034\n10.1016/j.rser.2017.03.103\n10.1007/s11869-020-00884-w\n10.1016/j.scitotenv.2019.04.269", "journal": "Environmental science and pollution research international", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33852118/", "date": "2021-04-15", "title": "The roles of economic growth and health expenditure on CO", "subfield": "Mortality", "authors": "Faik Bilgili, Sevda KuÅkaya, Masreka Khan, Ashar Awan, Oguzhan TÃ¼rk", "abstract": "Continuous economic growth and the rise in energy consumption are linked with environmental pollution.

In a sense, the two papers appear complementary, rather than in conflict with each other.

We argued that justice for all also means special duties for special risks. Indeed, a contact tracing app, which is mandatory for international travellers, is a threat to fundamental rights.

In severe COVID-19 infection, many immune cells and their products are involved, making management difficult. The abundant release of cytokines and chemokines in severe COVID-19 patients leads to profound hyper inflammation and the mobilization of immune cells, triggering the cytokine storm. The complications associated with the cytokine storm include severe respiratory distress, intravascular coagulation, multi-organ failure, and death. The enormous formation of interleukin (IL)-6 and hemopoietic factors such as granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) are implicated in the severity of the infection. Moreover, these inflammatory cytokines and factors signal through the Janus kinase (JAK)-signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) pathway causing the activation of cytokine-related genes. The neutralization of these proteins could be of therapeutic help in COVID-19 patients and could mitigate the risk of mortality. IL-6 antagonist, IL-6 receptor antagonists, GM-CSF receptor inhibitors, and JAK-STAT inhibitors are being investigated to prevent intense lung injury in COVID-19 patients and increase the chances of survival.

This review article considers the environments and settings that create the backdrop for children's health in the United States during the COVID-19 pandemic, including current threats to child development that stem from: A) change in exposures to environmental contaminants such as heavy metals, pesticides, disinfectants, air pollution and the built environment; B) changes in food environments resulting from adverse economic repercussion of the pandemic and limited reach of existing safety nets; C) limited access to children's educational and developmental resources; D) changes in the social environments at the individual and household levels, and their interplay with family stressors and mental health; E) social injustice and racism. The environmental changes due to COVID-19 are overlaid onto existing environmental and social disparities.

This region has become an epicenter for the coronavirus. In the Americas, Brazil and Mexico are second to the US in COVID related death. Existing surveillance provides a proxy of COVID-19 caseload and deaths; however, these measures make it difficult to identify shifts to the pandemic and where outbreaks are likely to occur. Moreover, existing surveillance techniques fail to measure the dynamics of the pandemic.This study aims to provide additional surveillance metrics for SARS-Cov-2 transmission that more accurately tracks shifts in the pandemic's, speed, acceleration, jerk, and persistence in transmission than existing metrics. Enhanced surveillance will inform policy and COVID-19 outbreaks for leaders in LAC.Using a longitudinal trend analysis study design, we extracted 45 days of COVID data from public health registries. We use an empirical difference equation to measure the daily number of cases in the Latin America and Caribbean region as a function of the prior number of cases, the level of testing, and weekly shift variables based on a dynamic panel model that was estimated using the generalized method of moments (GMM) approach by implementing the Arellano-Bond estimator in R.COVID transmission rates were tracked for Latin America and the Caribbean during the weeks of 9/30-10/06 and 10/07-10/13. New cases in the region totaled 79,053 on 10/06 and 42,837 on 10/13. The 7-day moving average of new cases for the week of 10/6 was 56,106 and for the week of 10/13 was 47,276. Total infection rate decreased from 12.42 to 6.73 accompanied by a death rate decrease from 0.33 to 0.24. Within the region, on 9/30, Brazil had the largest number of new cases at 41,906 followed by Argentina at 14,740, Colombia at 7,650, and Mexico at 4,828. On 10/07, Argentina had the largest number of new cases in the region at 13,305, followed by Brazil at 10,220, Colombia at 5,014, and Mexico at 4,295. For both weeks, Brazil had the highest 7-day moving average, followed by Argentina. The region as a whole saw a decrease in speed, acceleration, and jerk for the week of 10/13 compared to the week of 10/6, accompanied by a decrease in new cases and 7-day moving average. For the week of 10/6, Belize had the highest acceleration and jerk in the region, at 1.7 and 1.8 respectively, which is particularly concerning given the high death rate in the country. The Bahamas also had a high acceleration at 1.5. Eleven11 countries had a positive acceleration during the week of 10/6 whereas only six countries had a positive acceleration for the week of 10/13. The region overall is trending positively, with a speed of 10.40, an acceleration of 0.27, and a jerk of -0.31 all decreasing the subsequent week to 9.04, -0.81 and -0.03 respectively.Metrics such as new cases, cumulative cases, deaths, and 7-day moving averages provide a static view of the pandemic but fail to identify where and the speed at which SARS-CoV-19 is infecting new persons, the rate at which the speed is accelerating or decelerating and comparing this week to last week, how the rate of acceleration is increasing or decreasing indicate pending explosive growth or control of the pandemic. Although Latin America and the Caribbean saw an overall decrease in speed, acceleration, and jerk for the week of 10/13 compared to the week of 10/6, accompanied by a decrease in new cases and 7-day moving average, this is largely due to decreases in infections in Brazil and Mexico, the two countries containing over 50% of the population in the region.

Minimally invasive and digital approaches, with less possible exposure and interaction, are suggested to reduce the risk of infection.The failure of a short-span implant prosthetic rehabilitation combined with pain and mobility of the involved teeth was the main complaint reported by a 78-year-old male patient, who asked an urgent appointment to solve the problem. An intraoral scanner allowed the clinician to immediately take a preliminary digital impression of the arch to be treated. The resulting 3D files were sent by e-mail to the dental technician who provided a digital wax-up for the computerized workflow. Computer-aided implantology (CAI) performed using an in-office cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) allowed clinician to guide the surgical approach in a prosthetic manner. Such an integration inside a well-defined workflow was the key for a successful and rapid treatment.By using new innovative digital technology, the treatment was completed in 1 day, reducing the risk of COVID-19 by limiting the number of appointments and reducing contacts in confined environments like the dental office and public transportations. It also helped to reduce materials production and people movement in the treatment of dental emergency.The possibility of performing an effective treatment saving time by using efficient technology and a minimally invasive procedure highlights the importance of digital planning in order to optimize every single step of the treatment.

Numerous regions of the world have had varying responses in their attempts to contain the spread of the virus. Factors such as public health policies, governance, and sociopolitical climate, have led to differential levels of success at controlling the spread of SARS-CoV-2. Ultimately, a more advanced surveillance metric for COVID-19 transmission is necessary to help government systems and national leaders understand which responses have been effective and gauge where outbreaks occur.The goal of this study is to provide advanced COVID-19 surveillance metrics for Canada at the country, province, and territory level that account for shifts in the pandemic including speed, acceleration, jerk and persistence. Enhanced surveillance identifies risks for explosive growth and regions that have tamped out outbreaks successfully.Using a longitudinal trend analysis study design, we extracted 62 days of COVID data from Canadian public health registries for 13 provinces and territories. We used an empirical difference equation to measure the daily number of cases in Canada as a function of the prior number of cases, the level of testing, and weekly shift variables based on a dynamic panel model that was estimated using the generalized method of moments (GMM) approach by implementing the Arellano-Bond estimator in R.We compare the week of February 7-13, 2021 with the week of February 14-20, 2021. Canada, as a whole, had a decrease in speed from 8.4 daily new cases per 100,000 population to 7.5 daily new cases per 100,000 population. The persistence of new cases during the week of February 14-20 reported 7.5 cases that are a result of COVID transmissions 7 days earlier.

Nunavut experienced a significant increase in speed during this time from 3.3 daily new cases per 100,000 population to 10.9 daily new cases per 100,000 population.Canada excelled at COVID control early on in the pandemic, especially during the Great COVID Shutdown.

Whether these changes also make pregnant women less responsive to vaccination or induce altered immune responses to vaccination remains incompletely understood. To holistically define potential changes in vaccine response during pregnancy and lactation, we deeply profiled the humoral vaccine response in a group of pregnant and lactating women and non-pregnant age-matched controls. Vaccine-specific titers were comparable, albeit slightly lower, between pregnant and lactating women, compared to non-pregnant controls. Among pregnant women, we found higher antibody titers and functions in those vaccinated with the Moderna vaccine.

Historically, hospitals are supplied with electrosurgical devices from several manufacturers, and those devices are often evaluated separately; it may be more efficient to evaluate the category holistically. This study assessed the health economic impact of adopting an electrosurgical device-category from a single manufacturer.A budget impact model was developed from a U.S. hospital perspective. The uptake of electrosurgical devices from EES (Ethicon Electrosurgery), including ultrasonic, advanced bipolar, smoke evacuators, and reusable -dispersive electrodes were compared with similar MED (Medical Energy Devices) from multiple manufacturers. It was assumed that an average hospital performed 10,000 annual procedures 80% of which involved electrosurgery. Current utilization assumed 100% MED use, including advanced energy, conventional smoke mitigation options (e.g., ventilation, masks), and single-use disposable dispersive electrode devices. Future utilization assumed 100% EES use, including advanced energy devices, smoke evacuators (i.e., 80% uptake), and reusable dispersive electrodes. Surgical specialties included colorectal, bariatric, gynecology, thoracic and general surgery. Systematic reviews, network meta-analyses, and meta-regressions informed operating room (OR) time, hospital stay, and transfusion model inputs. Costs were assigned to model parameters, and price parity was assumed for advanced energy devices. The costs of disposables for dispersive electrodes and smoke-evacuators were included.The base-case analysis, which assessed the adoption of EES instead of MED for an average U.S. hospital predicted an annual savings of $824,760 ($101 per procedure). Savings were attributable to associated reductions with EES in OR time, days of hospital stay, and volume of disposable electrodes. Sensitivity analyses were consistent with these base-case findings.Category-wide adoption of electrosurgical devices from a single manufacturer demonstrated economic advantages compared with disaggregated product uptake.

We go on to use this high-frequency dataset to infer the effect of individual non-pharmaceutical interventions on maritime exports, which we use as a proxy of economic activity. Our results show widespread port-level trade losses, with the largest absolute losses found for ports in China, the Middle-East and Western Europe, associated with the collapse of specific supply-chains (e.g. oil, vehicle manufacturing). In total, we estimate that global maritime trade reduced by -7.0% to -9.6% during the first eight months of 2020, which is equal to around 206-286 million tonnes in volume losses and up to 225-412 billion USD in value losses. We find large sectoral and geographical disparities in impacts. Manufacturing sectors are hit hardest, with losses up to 11.8%, whilst some small islands developing states and low-income economies suffered the largest relative trade losses. Moreover, we find a clear negative impact of COVID-19 related school and public transport closures on country-wide exports.

International aviation data was approximately used to estimate the flux fraction matrix, and the effective distance was calculated. Through parameter estimation and simulation, the theoretical values of the modified model fit well with practical values. By adjusting the parameters and observing the change of the results, we found that the modified model is more in line with the actual needs and has higher credibility in the comprehensive analysis. The assessment shows that the number of confirmed cases worldwide will reach about 20 million optimistically. In severe cases, the peak value will exceed 80 million, and the late stage of the epidemic shows a long tail shape, lasting more than one and a half years.

Objective To measure burnout and describe the work and psychosocial factors affecting pharmacists during COVID-19, and to compare males and females. Setting An online survey was distributed to a convenience sample of pharmacists practicing in any setting in Australia during April and June 2020. Method The survey collected demographic data, burnout scores using the validated Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI), psychosocial and work-related variables using questions adapted from previous surveys. It was tested for readability by a group of pharmacists and academic clinicians before distribution via social media and professional organisations. Main outcome measure Burnout was calculated using mean MBI scores, descriptive statistics were used to report work and psychosocial variables and Pearson's chi-square compared males and females. Results Overall, 647 responses were analysed. Most participants were female nâ=â487 (75.7%) with hospital nâ=â269 (42.2%) and community nâ=â253 (39.9%) pharmacists well represented. Mean (SD) for emotional exhaustion (possible range 0-54) and depersonalisation (possible range 0-30) were 28.5 (13.39) and 7.98 (5.64), which were higher (increased burnout) than reported pre-COVID-19. Personal accomplishment (range 0-48, lower scores associated with burnout) mean (SD) 36.58 (7.56), was similar to previously reported. Males reported higher depersonalisation indicating more withdrawal and cynicism. Working overtime, medication supply and patient incivility were reported to affect work.

We conducted a needs assessment of how Veterans Affairs (VA) facilities address and manage disposal of unused opioid medications to identify opportunities for improvement.We used rapid qualitative content analysis methods with team consensus to synthesize findings. Data were collected in 2 waves: (1) semistructured interviews with 19 providers in October 2019 and (2) structured questions to 21 providers in March to April of 2020 addressing how coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) changed disposal priorities.While many diverse strategies have been tried in the VA, we found limited standardization of advice on opioid disposal and practices nationally. Providers offered the following recommendations: target specific patient scenarios for enhanced disposal efforts, emphasize mail-back envelopes, keep recommendations to providers and patients consistent and reinforce existing guidance, explore virtual modalities to monitor disposal activity, prioritize access to viable disposal strategies, and transition from pull to push communication. These themes were identified in the fall of 2019 and remained salient in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic.A centralized VA national approach could include proactive communication with patients and providers, interventions tailored to specific settings and populations, and facilitated access to disposal options.

For influenza in schools, the Center of Disease Control (CDC) recommends that febrile students remain isolated at home until they have been fever-free for at least one day and a related policy is recommended for SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19). Other authors proposed using a school week of four or fewer days of in-person instruction for all students to reduce transmission. However, there is limited evidence supporting the effectiveness of these interventions.We introduced a mathematical model of school outbreaks that considers both intervention methods. Our model accounts for the school structure and schedule, as well as the time-progression of fever symptoms and viral shedding. The model was validated on outbreaks of seasonal and pandemic influenza and COVID-19 in schools. It was then used to estimate the outbreak curves and the proportion of the population infected (attack rate) under the proposed interventions.For influenza, the CDC-recommended one day of post-fever isolation can reduce the attack rate by a median (interquartile range) of 29 (13-59)%. With 2 days of post-fever isolation the attack rate could be reduced by 70 (55-85)%. Alternatively, shortening the school week to 4 and 3 days reduces the attack rate by 73 (64-88)% and 93 (91-97)%, respectively. For COVID-19, application of post-fever isolation policy was found to be less effective and reduced the attack rate by 10 (5-17)% for a 2-day isolation policy and by 14 (5-26)% for 14 days. A 4-day school week would reduce the median attack rate in a COVID-19 outbreak by 57 (52-64)%, while a 3-day school week would reduce it by 81 (79-83)%. In both infections, shortening the school week significantly reduced the duration of outbreaks.Shortening the school week could be an important tool for controlling influenza and COVID-19 in schools and similar settings.

Proteolytic digestions of Mpro revealed Cys300 as a primary target of glutathionylation, and experiments using a C300S Mpro mutant revealed that Cys300 is required for inhibition of activity upon Mpro glutathionylation. These findings indicate that Mpro dimerization and activity can be regulated through reversible glutathionylation of Cys300 and provides a novel target for the development of agents to block Mpro dimerization and activity.

Studies have demonstrated that interactions between single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and lifestyle interventions like food and exercise may vary metabolic outcomes, contributing to obesity and therapeutic response. However, there is a paucity of research relating outcomes from digital therapeutics to inclusion of genetic data in care interventions.This study aims to describe and model weight loss of subjects enrolled in a precision digital weight loss program informed by machine learning analysis of subject data, including genomic. It was hypothesized that weight loss models would exhibit better fit when incorporating genomic data than utilizing demographic and engagement variables alone.A cohort of 393 participants enrolled in Digbi's personalized digital care program for 120 days was analyzed retrospectively. Care protocol included the use of subject data informing precision coaching by mobile app and personal coach. Two linear regression models of weight loss in this cohort (pounds lost, percentage lost) as a function of demographic and behavioral engagement variables were fit. Genomic-enhanced models were built by adding 197 SNPs from subject genomic data as predictors, then refitting, employing Lasso regression on SNPs for variable selection. Success/failure logistic regression models were also fit, with and without genomic data.72% of subjects in this cohort lost weight, while 17% maintained stable weight. 142 subjects lost 5% within 120 days. Models describe the impact of demographic and clinical factors, behavioral engagement, and genomic risk on weight loss. The addition of genomic predictors improved the mean squared error of weight loss models (pounds lost and percent) from 70 to 60 and 16 to 13 respectively. The logistic model improved pseudo R2 from 0.193 to 0.285. Gender, engagement and specific SNPs were significantly associated with weight loss. SNPs within genes involved in metabolic pathways that process food and regulate storage of fat were associated with weight loss in this cohort. This included rs17300539_G (insulin resistance, monounsaturated fat metabolism), rs2016520_C (BMI, waist circumference, cholesterol metabolism), and rs4074995_A (calcium-potassium transport, serum calcium levels). Models described greater average weight loss for subjects having more of these risk alleles. Notably, coaching for dietary modification was personalized to these genetic risks.Adding genomic information in modeling outcomes of a digital precision weight loss program greatly enhanced model accuracy. Interpretable weight loss models pointed to efficacy of coaching informed by subjects' genomic risk, accompanied by active engagement of subjects in their own success. While large-scale validation is needed, our study preliminarily supports precision dietary interventions for weight loss utilizing genetic risk, with digitally delivered recommendations alongside health-coaching to improve intervention efficacy.", "preprint": false}, "144182": {"doi": "10.1002/jmv.26979", "journal": "Journal of medical virology", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33851434/", "date": "2021-04-15", "title": "Emerging concerns regarding COVID-19; second wave and new variant.", "subfield": "Vaccination", "authors": "Sara Hafeez, Misbahud Din, Fatima Zia, Muhammad Ali, Zabta Khan Shinwa", "abstract": "", "preprint": false}, "143850": {"doi": "10.1093/cid/ciab313", "journal": "Clinical infectious diseases : an official publication of the Infectious Diseases Society of America", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33851214/", "date": "2021-04-15", "title": "Nosocomial outbreak of COVID-19 by possible airborne transmission leading to a superspreading event.", "subfield": "Treatment", "authors": "Vincent Chi-Chung Cheng, Kitty Sau-Chun Fung, Gilman Kit-Hang Siu, Shuk-Ching Wong, Lily Shui-Kuen Cheng, Man-Sing Wong, Lam-Kwong Lee, Wan-Mui Chan, Ka-Yee Chau, Jake Siu-Lun Leung, Allen Wing-Ho Chu, Wai-Shan Chan, Kelvin Keru Lu, Kingsley King-Gee Tam, Jonathan Daniel Ip, Kenneth Siu-Sing Leung, David Christopher Lung, Herman Tse, Kelvin Kai-Wang To, Kwok-Yung Yu", "abstract": "Nosocomial outbreaks with superspreading of COVID-19 due to a possible airborne transmission has not been reported.Epidemiological analysis, environmental samplings, and whole genome sequencing (WGS) were performed for a hospital outbreak.A superspreading event involving 12 patients and 9 healthcare workers (HCWs) occurred within 4 days in 3 of 6 cubicles at an old-fashioned general ward with no air exhaust built within the cubicles.

Blockchain technology can solve the problems in the current supply chain finance business, such as incorrect information between banks and enterprises, lack of visibility in transaction process, and possible joint fraud in the core enterprise model. However, it still has problems such as inconvenient information verification, data fraud, and difficulty to achieve a balance between efficiency, security and cost. This paper presents a hybrid chain model combining PANDA (a consensus algorithm based on public chain) and X-Alliance (a consensus algorithm based on alliance chain). Such proposed hybrid chain model can process the transaction of each account in parallel, asynchronize from other unrelated accounts in the network, provide more reliable data storage and authority management, and ensure the ownership of change tracking data, which has higher performance and lower protection cost while ensuring data security and privacy security. According to the data of network crawling, the experimental results show that the throughput can reach 1200tps when four nodes are deployed. The model serves for the supply chain financial data management of engineering projects, making trade authenticity review, risk assessment and credit transmission of core enterprises more efficient. On this basis, each participant can carry out analysis and give early warning of capital flow, timely analyze and calculate the authenticity of transaction background.

In this online survey, we were interested in measure how much loss of control was perceived regarding online gambling, online shopping, the fruition of online pornographic content and web navigation.The online survey was carried out during the COVID-19 pandemic in the post-lockdown and 1232 subjects participated in the survey. In the participating sample, healthcare workers (HW) were 43.1% of the sample, of which 18.7% were directly involved in the Coronavirus emergency, and 52.3% of the sample is not a HW. Only 0.6% of the sample gambled online and 37.5% of those reported losing control of their gambling mode. Most of the sample shopped online during the LD (70.1%), but only 7.2% of those lost control by buying and/or spending more than what they had set themselves.Significant data emerged showing that those who lost control while online shopping also lost control regarding the amount of time spent online (p<0.001); 21.6% of the sample, reported making use of online pornographic material during LD, 4.7% of them stated that the frequency increased and 5.1% reported losing control by having spent more money or more time than what was intended.

Of these, 8.4% state that they enacted behaviors such as online gambling, online shopping, online pornographic material viewing and web navigation to counter their negative emotions. Interestingly, we found a correlation between loss of control during web navigation and online shopping and the emotional states \"upset\", \"scared\" and \"restless\" (p<0.05).To conclude, there was no significant increase in potentially addictive behaviors, nor an increase in loss of control of these behaviors when enacted online. However, the loss of control in online shopping and web navigation was significantly correlated to the unpleasant emotional states of nervousness, fear and restlessness, whereas those who reported feeling strong and able to handle the situation experienced a lower loss of control in their web navigation.

As of April 28, 2020, South Africa reported the highest number of COVID-19 cases in Sub-Sahara Africa. The country took aggressive steps to control the spread of the virus including setting a national command team for COVID-19 and putting the country on a complete lockdown for more than 100 days. Evidence across most countries has shown that, it is vital to monitor the progression of pandemics and assess the effects of various public health measures, such as lockdowns. Countries need to have scientific tools to assist in monitoring and assessing the effectiveness of mitigation interventions. The objective of this study was thus to assess the extent to which a systems dynamics model can forecast COVID-19 infections in South Africa and be a useful tool in evaluating government interventions to manage the epidemic through 'what if' simulations.This study presents a systems dynamics model (SD) of the COVID-19 infection in South Africa, as one of such tools. The development of the SD model in this study is grounded in design science research which fundamentally builds on prior research of modelling complex systems.The SD model satisfactorily replicates the general trend of COVID-19 infections and recovery for South Africa within the first 100 days of the pandemic. The model further confirms that the decision to lockdown the country was a right one, otherwise the country's health capacity would have been overwhelmed. Going forward, the model predicts that the level of infection in the country will peak towards the last quarter of 2020, and thereafter start to decline.Â  Conclusions: Ultimately, the model structure and simulations suggest that a systems dynamics model can be a useful tool in monitoring, predicting and testing interventions to manage COVID-19 with an acceptable margin of error.

In the United States, policies on mask wearing have varied from state to state over the course of the pandemic. Even as more and more states encourage or even mandate mask wearing, many citizens still resist the notion. Our research examines mask wearing policy and adherence in association with COVID-19 case rates. We used state-level data on mask wearing policy for the general public and on proportion of residents who stated they always wear masks in public. For all 50 states and the District of Columbia (DC), these data were abstracted by month for April â September 2020 to measure their impact on COVID-19 rates in the subsequent month (May â October 2020). Monthly COVID-19 case rates (number of cases per capita over two weeks) >200 per 100,000 residents were considered high. Fourteen of the 15 states with no mask wearing policy for the general public through September reported a high COVID-19 rate. Of the 8 states with at least 75% mask adherence, none reported a high COVID-19 rate. States with the lowest levels of mask adherence were most likely to have high COVID-19 rates in the subsequent month, independent of mask policy or demographic factors. Mean COVID-19 rates for states with at least 75% mask adherence in the preceding month was 109.26 per 100,000 compared to 249.99 per 100,000 for those with less adherence. Our analysis suggests high adherence to mask wearing could be a key factor in reducing the spread of COVID-19.

Lipids, particularly ceramides, cholesterol, and free fatty acids, together form lamellar membranes in the extracellular spaces of the SC that limit the loss of water and electrolytes. In addition to preventing water and electrolyte loss, the SC as a permeability barrier prevents the entry of harmful irritants, allergens, and microorganisms into the skin. Disruption of the epidermal barrier leads to skin that is irritated, more reactive, and more sensitive than normal skin. SC thickness, lipid profile, and barrier function vary with different ethnic groups, which is also reflected the differences in prevalence and manifestation of diverse skin conditions related to the skin barrier function such as atopic dermatitis and sensitive skin. In addition to these compromised skin barrier related conditions, we are just now starting to understand the direct and indirect impact of COVID-19 on the skin and how current preventative measures are contributing to skin barrier disorders. Our understanding of various approaches for restoration of skin barrier, especially the role of topically applied mixtures of cholesterol, ceramides, and essential/nonessential free fatty acids (FFAs) allows for the strengthening of the compromised skin barrier and alleviation of symptoms and discomfort associated with skin barrier disorders. Ceramide containing products on the market are commonly available and offer protection and reparative benefits to the skin barrier.

We find significant positive effects of PM10 concentration on death numbers from four days before to ten days after the onset of symptoms. Specifically, for elderly patients (80+ years) an increase in ambient PM10 concentration by one standard deviation between two and four days after developing symptoms increases the number of deaths by 19 percent of a standard deviation.

Therefore, we investigated the very first interactions of primary human airway epithelial cells upon exposure to SARS-CoV-2 in terms of complement C3-mediated effects.For this, we used highly differentiated primary human 3D tissue models infected with SARS-CoV-2 patient isolates. Upon infection, viral load, viral infectivity, intracellular complement activation, inflammatory mechanisms and tissue destruction were analyzed by real-time RT-PCR, high content screening, plaque assays, luminex analyses and TEER measurements.Here we show that primary normal human bronchial and small airway epithelial cells respond to SARS-CoV-2 infection by an inflated local C3 mobilization. SARS-CoV-2 infection resulted in exaggerated intracellular complement activation and destruction of the epithelial integrity in monolayer cultures of primary human airway cells and highly differentiated, pseudostratified, mucus-producing, ciliated respiratory tissue models. SARS-CoV-2-infected 3D cultures secreted significantly higher levels of C3a and the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-6, MCP-1, IL-1Î± and RANTES.Crucially, we illustrate here for the first time, that targeting the anaphylotoxin receptors C3aR and C5aR in non-immune respiratory cells can prevent intrinsic lung inflammation and tissue damage.

However, the role of rodents in the transmission of MERS-CoV still requires more exploration. To achieve this goal, we identified MERS-CoV naturally infected dromedary camel by molecular surveillance. We captured 15 of the common rodents (rats, mice, and jerboa) sharing the habitat with these animals.

This study explored the SARS-CoV-2 stability in human biological fluids under different environmental conditions and estimated the half-life. The virus was stable for up to 21 days in nasal mucus, sputum, saliva, tear, urine, blood, and semen; it remained infectious significantly longer under winter and spring/fall conditions than under summer conditions.

The spike (S) protein of the SARS-CoV-2 virus plays a key role in binding to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), a host cell receptor for SARS-CoV-2. S proteins that are expressed on the cell membrane can initiate receptor-dependent syncytia formation that is associated with extensive tissue damage. Formation of syncytia have been previously observed in cells infected with various other viruses (e.g., HIV, Ebola, Influenza, and Herpesviruses). However, this phenomenon is not well documented and the mechanisms regulating the formation of these syncytia by SARS-CoV-2 are not fully understood. In this study, we investigated the possibility that cell fusion events mediated by the S protein of SARS-CoV-2 and ACE2 interaction can occur in different human cell lines that mimic different tissue origins. These cell lines were stably transduced with either wild-type (WT-S) S protein or a mutated variant where the ER-retention motif was removed (Î19-S), or human ACE2 vectors. Different co-culture combinations of spike-expressing 293T, A549, K562, and SK-Hep1 cells with hACE2-expressing cells revealed cell hybrid fusion. However, only certain cells expressing S protein can form syncytial structures as this phenomenon cannot be observed in all co-culture combinations. Thus, SARS-CoV-2 mediated cell-cell fusion represents a cell type-dependent process which might rely on a different set of parameters. Recently, the Î19-S variant is being widely used to increase SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus production for in vitro assays. Comparison of cell fusion occurring via Î19-S expressing cells shows defective nuclear fusion and syncytia formation compared to WT-S. This distinction between the Î19-S variant and WT-S protein may have downstream implications for studies that utilize pseudovirus-based entry assays. Additionally, this study suggest that spike protein expressed by vaccines may affect different ACE2-expressing host cells after SARS-CoV-2 vaccine administration. The long-term effects of these vaccines should be monitored carefully.", "preprint": false}, "143881": {"doi": "10.4081/monaldi.2021.1779", "journal": "Monaldi archives for chest disease = Archivio Monaldi per le malattie del torace", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33849264/", "date": "2021-04-15", "title": "Cardiac teleconsulting in the time of COVID-19 global pandemic: The \"Antonio Cardarelli\" Hospital project.", "subfield": "Healthcare System", "authors": "Eduardo Bossone, Ciro Mauro, Alfonso Maiellaro, Eliana Raiola, Rosangela Cocchia, Brigida Ranieri, Chiara Sepe, Valentina Capone, Salvatore Chianese, Renato Maramaldi, Enrico Pasquale Acerra, Gaetano Mirto, Sergio Lodato, Giuseppe Russo, Giuseppe Lon", "abstract": "Dear Editor, Teleconsulting - defined as real-time consultation between doctors by exploiting video conferencing technology over the Internet network - is exponentially being implemented through the western world lastly triggered by COVID-19 pandemic...", "preprint": false}, "143867": {"doi": "10.1080/10872981.2021.1913785", "journal": "Medical education online", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33849405/", "date": "2021-04-15", "title": "Effects of COVID-19 on career and specialty choices among Chinese medical students.", "subfield": "Mental Health", "authors": "Jiahui Deng, Jianyu Que, Suying Wu, Yingjian Zhang, Jiajia Liu, Sijing Chen, Yongxi Wu, Yimiao Gong, Siwei Sun, Kai Yuan, Yanping Bao, Maosheng Ran, Jie Shi, Yun Kwok Wing, Le Shi, Lin ", "abstract": "Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has brought unprecedented challenges to medical education systems and medical students.

This mild variation can make a difference when sample size is large as in case of this study.Screening for psychological and social disruptions is of importance to develop strategies by schools and healthcare providers to assess and monitor behavioral changes and negative psychologically during reintegration post-COVID-19. Participants experiencing higher levels of anxieties should be given extra attention during reintegration and transitional phases in schools. Although electronic devices and social media platforms may have lowered the level of anxiety in some cases, it is important to address how electronic devices and social media platforms are used and how content is tailored for children and adolescents. It is also important to maintain an active lifestyle for children and young adults, and encourage them not to neglect their physical health, as it promotes better psychological state of mind.", "preprint": false}, "143873": {"doi": "10.21037/apm-21-400", "journal": "Annals of palliative medicine", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33849115/", "date": "2021-04-15", "title": "Comparison of the antiviral effect of Arbidol and Chloroquine in treating COVID-19.", "subfield": "Clinical Studies", "authors": "Ming Li, Tongya Yu, Jinghua Zhu, Yinjia Wang, Yanxia Yang, Kaiwu Zhao, Yongning Yi, Juan He, Chao Li, Jian ", "abstract": "The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was broken out in December 2019 and soon became a global health emergency. Effective treatment for COVID-19 is urgently needed. In the present study, we aimed to evaluate the antiviral effect of Arbidol vs. Chloroquine in treating COVID-19.We retrospectively analyzed 62 patients with COVID-19 diagnosed according to the guidelines for diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19 in China. They were divided into two groups depending on the antiviral drugs that they received. Participants in the Arbidol group (n=42) received 0.2 g Arbidol, tid for 10 days,and those in Chloroquine group (n=20) received 500 mg Chloroquine, bid for 10 days. The coronavirus negative conversion time and the length of hospital stay were analyzed and compared between the two groups.There was no significant difference in demographic and clinical characteristics between the two groups. After antiviral treatment, the nasopharyngeal specimen negative conversion time of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and the length of hospital stay in the Arbidol group were significantly shorter than those in the Chloroquine group (18.50 vs. 25.05 days, P=0.001; 23.52 vs. 28.75 days, P=0.001). Adverse events observed during the antiviral treatment period were comparable between the two groups. Overall, 3 (7.14%) participants in the Arbidol group and 4 (20.0%) in the Chloroquine group experienced adverse events during antiviral treatment.These results suggest that Arbidol is advantageous over Chloroquine in terms of the SARS-CoV-2 negative conversion and the length of hospital stay in treating COVID-19 patients.", "preprint": false}, "143844": {"doi": "10.1038/s41598-021-87668-z\n10.1001/jama.2020.1585\n10.1001/jama.2020.2648\n10.1515/cclm-2020-0198\n10.1038/s41392-020-0148-4\n10.1038/s41591-019-0381-y\n10.1007/s10067-020-05049-9\n10.1038/nm.3260\n10.1016/j.chom.2020.04.009\n10.1001/jama.2019.5791\n10.1016/j.cell.2015.02.010\n10.1038/ni.3790\n10.1038/nri3787\n10.1016/j.autrev.2020.102537\n10.3389/fimmu.2019.00055\n10.1186/s12916-017-0930-5\n10.1002/art.24316\n10.1007/s10067-017-3625-6\n10.1016/S0140-6736(20)30566-3\n10.1016/j.cels.2016.09.009\n10.1038/s41577-019-0180-1\n10.3346/jkms.2017.32.12.1967\n10.1093/infdis/jix257\n10.1038/ncomms10369\n10.1097/PEC.0b013e3181c399df\n10.4236/ojs.2013.34A004\n10.1001/jamainternmed.2020.2033\n10.1016/j.is.2015.04.007\n10.1016/j.patcog.2010.09.013", "journal": "Scientific reports", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33850271/", "date": "2021-04-15", "title": "Pattern of inflammatory immune response determines the clinical course and outcome of COVID-19: unbiased clustering analysis.", "subfield": "Clinical Studies", "authors": "Eunyoung Emily Lee, Kyoung-Ho Song, Woochang Hwang, Sin Young Ham, Hyeonju Jeong, Jeong-Han Kim, Hong Sang Oh, Yu Min Kang, Eun Bong Lee, Nam Joong Kim, Bum Sik Chin, Jin Kyun Pa", "abstract": "The objective of the study was to identify distinct patterns in inflammatory immune responses of COVID-19 patients and to investigate their association with clinical course and outcome.

Supervised k-means clustering of serial C-reactive protein levels (CRP), absolute neutrophil counts (ANC), and absolute lymphocyte counts (ALC) was used to assign immune responses to one of three groups. Then, relationships between patterns of inflammatory responses and clinical course and outcome of COVID-19 were assessed in a discovery and validation cohort. Unbiased clustering analysis grouped 105 patients of a discovery cohort into three distinct clusters. Cluster 1 (hyper-inflammatory immune response) was characterized by high CRP levels, high ANC, and low ALC, whereas Cluster 3 (hypo-inflammatory immune response) was associated with low CRP levels and normal ANC and ALC. Cluster 2 showed an intermediate pattern. All patients in Cluster 1 required oxygen support whilst 61% patients in Cluster 2 and no patient in Cluster 3 required supplementary oxygen. Two (13.3%) patients in Cluster 1 died, whereas no patient in Clusters 2 and 3 died. The results were confirmed in an independent validation cohort of 116 patients.

Meditation and Yoga are practical and easy to implement psychomodulatory strategies that can naturally trigger vegetarianism and related eating behaviors, lowering our reliance on animal meat. Decreasing dependence on animal meat reduces the need for animal markets and may substantially minimize the likelihood of spillover (passage of viruses from animal reservoirs into human populations). Global implementation of these strategies, in our opinion, can add to spiritual wisdom, compassion, and cooperative human behavior, thus reducing the encroachment of wild-life reserves and animal exploitation.

The study is planned to be carried out within two separate cohorts in voluntary participants aged between 18-59 years old. The first cohort includes healthcare professionals actively working in healthcare units, who are assumed to have higher risk of acquiring COVID-19, and the second cohort includes other immunocompetent subjects in the same age group, who are at a regular risk for COVID-19 disease. In Cohort 1, healthcare professionals will be randomized to receive two intramuscular doses of investigational product or the placebo in a 1:1 ratio and they will be monitored for 12 months by active surveillance of COVID-19. In Cohort 2, immunocompetent subjects will be randomized to receive vaccine or the placebo in a 2:1 ratio.Healthcare professionals of both genders, including medical doctors, nurses, cleaners, hospital technicians, and administrative personnel who work in any department of a healthcare unit and immunocompetent individuals of both genders are included. Pregnant (confirmed by positive beta-hCG test) and breastfeeding women as well as those intending to become pregnant within three months after vaccination are excluded. Other exclusion criteria include history of COVID-19 test positivity (PCR or immunoglobulin test results), any form of immunosuppressive therapy including corticosteroids within 6 months, history of bleeding disorders, asplenia, and administration of any form of immunoglobulins or blood products within 3 months. Exclusion criteria for the second dose include any serious adverse events related with the vaccine, anaphylaxis or hypersensitivity after vaccination, or any confirmed or suspected autoimmune or immunosuppressive disease (including HIV infection). Participants are only included after signing the voluntary informed consent form, ensuring cooperation in visits, undergoing screening for evaluation, and conforming to all the inclusion and exclusion criteria. All clinical sites are located in Turkey.The vaccine was manufactured by Sinovac Research & Development Co., Ltd. It is a preparation made from a novel coronavirus (strain CZ02) grown in the kidney cell cultures (Vero Cell) of the African green monkey and contains inactivated SARS-CoV-2 virus, aluminium hydroxide, disodium hydrogen phosphate, sodium dihydrogen phosphate, and sodium chloride. A dose of 0.5 mL contains 600 SU of SARS-CoV-2 virus antigen. The placebo contains aluminium hydroxide, disodium hydrogen phosphate, sodium dihydrogen phosphate, and sodium chloride (0.5mL/dose). Scheduled visits and additional unscheduled weekly visits will be performed for the first 13 weeks and neutralizing antibody test, IgG test, T-Cell activation test, pregnancy test, and RT-PCR tests along with total antibody test will be performed. Adverse events and serious adverse events during the follow-up will be recorded on diary cards. Diary cards will collect information on the timing and severity of COVID-19 symptoms and solicited adverse events recorded by the subjects during one-year follow-up period. All serious adverse events will be managed and necessary treatment will be ensured according to the local regulations. All serious adverse events following vaccination will be reported to the ethics committee, the Ministry of Health, and the study sponsor within 24 hours of detection.The primary efficacy endpoint is the incidence of symptomatic cases of COVID-19 disease confirmed by RT-PCR two weeks after the second dose of vaccination. Secondary efficacy endpoints are the incidence of hospitalization/mortality rates among one or two dose regimens, duration of immunogenicity rates up to 120 days, the seroconversion rate, the seropositivity rate, neutralizing antibody titer, and IgG levels 14 days after each dose of vaccination. The primary safety endpoint is the severity and frequency of local and systemic adverse reactions during the period of one week after vaccination. The study would be terminated if more than 15% of the subjects have grade â¥3 adverse events related to vaccination including local reactions.Eligible subjects will be randomized at their Study Day 0 to two study groups using an Interactive Web Response System (IWRS; developed by Omega CRO, Ankara, Turkey) in both risk groups. The IWRS system customizes the randomization algorithm. After enrolment in the study, each participant will be randomly assigned to either of the two treatment arms at a ratio of 1:1 in the high-risk group and at a ratio of 2:1 in the normal risk group. Each enrolled participant will be assigned to a code and will receive the treatment labelled with the code.The trial is a double-blind study to avoid introducing bias. The blinding may be broken by the investigator in the event of a medical emergency in which knowledge of the identity of the study vaccine is critical for management of the subject's immediate treatment. The Data and Safety Monitoring Board is to be contacted in case of breaking the blinding for a study object. The blood samples will be taken from both placebo and vaccinated groups, in order not to break the blinding.The study is planned to be carried out with two separate cohorts. The Cohort 1 includes healthcare professionals working in healthcare units and the Cohort 2 consists of immunocompetent subjects having normal risk for COVID-19 disease. The Cohort 2 will be initiated after the evaluation of the interim safety report of the Cohort 1 by the Data and Safety Monitoring Board. Both cohorts will be followed-up via RT-PCR to confirm symptomatic COVID-19 cases. If the clinical efficacy of the vaccine is shown in the Cohort 1 or 2, the subjects randomized into the placebo arm will also be vaccinated. In the Cohort 1, 588 subjects should be included in both arms with the assumption that the risk of infection with COVID-19 will be 5% for the placebo arm and 2% for the vaccine arm in the high-risk group. Considering 10% of drop-out rate and 5% of seropositivity or PCR positivity at baseline, 680 subjects should be screened at both arms of the Cohort 1. Group sample sizes of 7545 SARS-CoV-2 vaccine and 3773 placebo suits at a two-sided 95% confidence interval for the difference in population proportions with a width equal to 1.0%, when the estimated incidence rate for vaccinated group is 1.0% and the estimated incidence rate for placebo group is 2.0%. Drop-out rate is assumed to be 10% and seropositivity or PCR positivity at baseline is assumed to be 5%; accordingly, 13000 participants are needed to be enrolled totally in both cohorts.

In this study, we developed and validated an accurate and reproducible normal phase chiral high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) method for the analysis of two enantiomers of HCQ, and the method was further evaluated with biological samples. With this newly developed method, the relative standard deviations of all analytes were lower than 5%, and the limits of quantification were 0.27Â Î¼g/ml, 0.34Â Î¼g/ml and 0.20Â Î¼g/ml for racemate, R- and S-enantiomer, respectively. The present method provides an essential analytical tool for preclinical and clinical evaluation of HCQ enantiomers for potential treatment of COVID-19.", "preprint": false}, "144060": {"doi": null, "journal": "Revista espanola de salud publica", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33850095/", "date": "2021-04-15", "title": "Collaboration experience between hospitals and long-term care facilities for the care of COVID-19 patients.", "subfield": "Treatment", "authors": "Pilar SÃ¡ez-LÃ³pez, Ana BelÃ©n Arredondo-Provec", "abstract": "The disease produced by SARS-CoV-2 has led to severe situations and mortality in elderly people.

It is known that the high mutation rate of RNA viruses can generate huge genetic diversity to facilitate viral adaptation. However, less attention has been paid to the underlying fitness landscape that represents the selection forces on viral genomes, especially under different selection conditions. Here, we systematically quantified the distribution of fitness effects of about 1,600 single amino acid substitutions in the drug-targeted region of NS5A protein of HCV. We found that the majority of nonsynonymous substitutions incur large fitness costs, suggesting that NS5A protein is highly optimized. The replication fitness of viruses is correlated with the pattern of sequence conservation in nature, and viral evolution is constrained by the need to maintain protein stability. We characterized the adaptive potential of HCV by subjecting the mutant viruses to selection by the antiviral drug daclatasvir at multiple concentrations. Both the relative fitness values and the number of beneficial mutations were found to increase with the increasing concentrations of daclatasvir. The changes in the spectrum of beneficial mutations in NS5A protein can be explained by a pharmacodynamics model describing viral fitness as a function of drug concentration. Overall, our results show that the distribution of fitness effects of mutations is modulated by both the constraints on the biophysical properties of proteins (i.e., selection pressure for protein stability) and the level of environmental stress (i.e., selection pressure for drug resistance).", "preprint": false}, "144026": {"doi": "10.1101/2021.04.01.21254804", "journal": "medRxiv : the preprint server for health sciences", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33851191/", "date": "2021-04-15", "title": "Predicting the severity of disease progression in COVID-19 at the individual and population level: A mathematical model.", "subfield": "Infection", "authors": "Narendra Chirmule, Pradip Nair, Bela Desai, Ravindra Khare, Vivek Nerurkar, Amitabh Ga", "abstract": "The impact of COVID-19 disease on health and economy has been global, and the magnitude of devastation is unparalleled in modern history.

This study also analysed the sentimental dynamics delivered by the hot topics in Twitter such as government policies (e.g. the Australia's JobKeeper program, lockdown, social-distancing) as well as the focused social events (e.g. the Ruby Princess Cruise). The results showed that the policies and events did affect people's overall sentiment, and they affected people's overall sentiment differently at different stages.", "preprint": false}, "144194": {"doi": "10.1002/hup.2789", "journal": "Human psychopharmacology", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33852168/", "date": "2021-04-15", "title": "Initiation of psychotropic medication in hospitalized patients with COVID-19: Association with clinical and biological characteristics.", "subfield": "Clinical Studies", "authors": "Enrico Capuzzi, Alice Caldiroli, Silvia Leo, Massimiliano Buoli, Massimo Cleri", "abstract": "Inpatients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) show a high rate of neuropsychiatric manifestations, possibly related to a higher risk of serious illness or death.

How AMs respond to SARS-CoV-2 invasion remains elusive. Here, we show that classically activated M1 AMs facilitate viral spread; however, alternatively activated M2 AMs limit the spread. M1 AMs utilize cellular softness to efficiently take up SARS-CoV-2. Subsequently, the invaded viruses take over the endo-lysosomal system to escape. M1 AMs have a lower endosomal pH, favoring membrane fusion and allowing the entry of viral RNA from the endosomes into the cytoplasm, where the virus achieves replication and is packaged to be released.

However, the use of existing ViT is not optimal, since feature embedding through direct patch flattening or ResNet backbone in the standard ViT is not intended for CXR. To address this problem, here we propose a novel Vision Transformer that utilizes low-level CXR feature corpus obtained from a backbone network that extracts common CXR findings. Specifically, the backbone network is first trained with large public datasets to detect common abnormal findings such as consolidation, opacity, edema, etc. Then, the embedded features from the backbone network are used as corpora for a Transformer model for the diagnosis and the severity quantification of COVID-19. We evaluate our model on various external test datasets from totally different institutions to evaluate the generalization capability. The experimental results confirm that our model can achieve the state-of-the-art performance in both diagnosis and severity quantification tasks with superior generalization capability, which are sine qua non of widespread deployment.", "preprint": true}, "144474": {"doi": "empty", "journal": "arxiv", "url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2104.07172v1", "date": "2021-04-15", "title": "COVID-19 Clinical footprint to infer about mortality", "subfield": "Epidemiology", "authors": "Carlos E.

The production of goods and services is a highly interdependent process and can be severely impacted by the default of critical suppliers or customers. While knowing the impact of individual companies on national economies is a prerequisite for efficient risk management, the quantitative assessment of the involved economic systemic risks (ESR) is hitherto practically non-existent, mainly because of a lack of fine-grained data in combination with coherent methods. Based on a unique value added tax dataset we derive the detailed production network of an entire country and present a novel approach for computing the ESR of all individual firms. We demonstrate that a tiny fraction (0.035%) of companies has extraordinarily high systemic risk impacting about 23% of the national economic production should any of them default. Firm size alone cannot explain the ESR of individual companies; their position in the production networks does matter substantially. If companies are ranked according to their economic systemic risk index (ESRI), firms with a rank above a characteristic value have very similar ESRI values, while for the rest the rank distribution of ESRI decays slowly as a power-law; 99.8% of all companies have an impact on less than 1% of the economy. We show that the assessment of ESR is impossible with aggregate data as used in traditional Input-Output Economics.

Existing deep learning based methods have made remarkable progress in NIR-VIS face recognition, while it encounters certain newly-emerged difficulties during the pandemic of COVID-19, since people are supposed to wear facial masks to cut off the spread of the virus. We define this task as NIR-VIS masked face recognition, and find it problematic with the masked face in the NIR probe image. First, the lack of masked face data is a challenging issue for the network training. Second, most of the facial parts (cheeks, mouth, nose etc.) are fully occluded by the mask, which leads to a large amount of loss of information. Third, the domain gap still exists in the remaining facial parts. In such scenario, the existing methods suffer from significant performance degradation caused by the above issues. In this paper, we aim to address the challenge of NIR-VIS masked face recognition from the perspectives of training data and training method. Specifically, we propose a novel heterogeneous training method to maximize the mutual information shared by the face representation of two domains with the help of semi-siamese networks. In addition, a 3D face reconstruction based approach is employed to synthesize masked face from the existing NIR image. Resorting to these practices, our solution provides the domain-invariant face representation which is also robust to the mask occlusion.

Here, we show an unprecedented de-carbonization of China's power system in late 2020: although China's power related carbon emissions were 0.5% higher in 2020 than 2019, the majority (92.9%) of the increased power demand was met by increases in low-carbon (renewables and nuclear) generation (increased by 9.3%), as compared to only 0.4% increase for fossil fuels. China's low-carbon generation in the country grew in the second half of 2020, supplying a record high of 36.7% (increased by 1.9% compared to 2019) of total electricity in 2020, when the fossil production dropped to a historical low of 63.3%. Combined, the carbon intensity of China's power sector decreased to an historical low of 519.9 tCO2/GWh in 2020. If the fast decarbonization and slowed down power demand growth from 2019 to 2020 were to continue, by 2030, over half (50.8%) of China's power demand could be provided by low carbon sources.

But, throughout the world, many citizens don't understand well how these measures are taken and even question the decisions taken by their government. Should the measures be more (or less) restrictive? Are they taken for a too long (or too short) period of time? To provide some quantitative elements of response to these questions, we consider the well-known SEIR model for the Covid-19 epidemic propagation and propose a pragmatic model of the government decision-making operation. Although simple and obviously improvable, the proposed model allows us to study the tradeoff between health and economic aspects in a pragmatic and insightful way. Assuming a given number of phases for the epidemic and a desired tradeoff between health and economic aspects, it is then possible to determine the optimal duration of each phase and the optimal severity level for each of them. The numerical analysis is performed for the case of France but the adopted approach can be applied to any country. One of the takeaway messages of this analysis is that being able to implement the optimal 4-phase epidemic management strategy in France would have led to 1.05 million infected people and a GDP loss of 231 billion euro instead of 6.88 million of infected and a loss of 241 billion euro. This indicates that, seen from the proposed model perspective, the effectively implemented epidemic management strategy is good economically, whereas substantial improvements might have been obtained in terms of health impact. Our analysis indicates that the lockdown/severe phase should have been more severe but shorter, and the adjustment phase occurred earlier.

DESIGN: Retrospective cohort, analysed using a matched nested case-control study design.   SETTING: Community-based SARS-CoV-2 testing in England, individually linked with hospitalisation data from the Secondary Uses Service and the Emergency Care Data Set.   PARTICIPANTS: 493,053 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patients, of whom 19,482 had been hospitalised, tested between 23 November 2020 and 4 January 2021 and analysed at a laboratory with an available TaqPath assay that enables assessment of S-gene target failure (SGTF).

RESULTS: The matching-adjusted conditional odds ratio of hospitalisation was 1.58 (95% confidence interval 1.50 to 1.67) for COVID-19 patients infected with a SGTF-associated variant, compared to those infected with non-SGTF-associated variants.

However, the one certainty with the COVID-19 pandemic is that these parameters change over time, as well as vary across counties and states. In fact, the rate of spread over region, hospitalization rate, hospital length of stay and mortality rate, the proportion of the population that is susceptible, test positivity rate, and social behaviors can all change significantly over time. Thus, the quantification of uncertainty becomes critical in making meaningful and accurate forecasts of the future. Bayesian approaches are a natural way to fully represent this uncertainty in mathematical models and have become particularly popular in physics and engineering models. The explicit integration time varying parameters and uncertainty quantification into a hierarchical Bayesian forecast model differentiates the Mayo COVID-19 model from other forecasting models. By accounting for all sources of uncertainty in both parameter estimation as well as future trends with a Bayesian approach, the Mayo COVID-19 model accurately forecasts future cases and hospitalizations, as well as the degree of uncertainty.

These tasks, however, often come with many challenges when using classical machine learning models due to a myriad of factors including class imbalance and data heterogeneity (i.e., the complex intra-class variances). To address some of these research gaps, this paper leverages the exciting contrastive learning framework and proposes a novel contrastive regularized clinical classification model. The contrastive loss is found to substantially augment EHR-based prediction: it effectively characterizes the similar/dissimilar patterns (by its \"push-and-pull\" form), meanwhile mitigating the highly skewed class distribution by learning more balanced feature spaces (as also echoed by recent findings). In particular, when naively exporting the contrastive learning to the EHR data, one hurdle is in generating positive samples, since EHR data is not as amendable to data augmentation as image data. To this end, we have introduced two unique positive sampling strategies specifically tailored for EHR data: a feature-based positive sampling that exploits the feature space neighborhood structure to reinforce the feature learning; and an attribute-based positive sampling that incorporates pre-generated patient similarity metrics to define the sample proximity. Both sampling approaches are designed with an awareness of unique high intra-class variance in EHR data. Our overall framework yields highly competitive experimental results in predicting the mortality risk on real-world COVID-19 EHR data with a total of 5,712 patients admitted to a large, urban health system.

Using Blockchain technology not only secures our system against single point of failure and denial of service attacks, but also brings transparency because all transactions can be validated by different parties. Although contact tracing is important, it is not enough to effectively control an infection. Thus, unlike most of the existing systems that focus only on contact tracing, our system consists of three integrated subsystems, including contact tracing, public places access control, and safe-places recommendation. The access control subsystem prevents infected people from visiting public places to prevent spreading the virus, and the recommendation subsystem categorizes zones based on the infection level so that people can avoid visiting contaminated zones. Our analysis demonstrates that our system is secure and preserves the privacy of the users against identification, social graph disclosure, and tracking attacks, while thwarting false reporting (or panic) attacks.

Using cumulative and daily reported cases of infectives, we simulate the impact of non-pharmaceutical mitigation measures such as early detection of infectives, contact tracing, and social distancing on the basic reproduction number. We demonstrate the effectiveness of vaccination, a pharmaceutical mitigation measure, together with non-pharmaceutical mitigation measures on the daily reported infectives. The EINN algorithms discover time-varying infection and recovery rates. The Mean Squared Error is used to demonstrate the accuracy of the proposed EINN algorithms. Simulations are presented for Italy, South Korea, United Kingdom, and the United States.", "preprint": true}, "139260": {"doi": "empty", "journal": "arxiv", "url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2104.02042v1", "date": "2021-04-05", "title": "Automated lung segmentation from CT images of normal and COVID-19 pneumonia patients", "subfield": "Epidemiology", "authors": "Faeze Gholamiankhah, Samaneh Mostafapour, Nouraddin Abdi Goushbolagh, Seyedjafar Shojaerazavi, Parvaneh Layegh, Seyyed Mohammad Tabatabaei, Hossein Arabi", "abstract": "Automated semantic image segmentation is an essential step in quantitative image analysis and disease diagnosis.

The reference lung masks were generated through semi-automated/manual segmentation of the CT images. The performance of the model was evaluated on two distinct external test datasets including 120 normal and COVID-19 subjects, and the results of these groups were compared to each other. Different evaluation metrics such as dice coefficient (DSC), mean absolute error (MAE), relative mean HU difference, and relative volume difference were calculated to assess the accuracy of the predicted lung masks. The proposed deep learning method achieved DSC of 0.980 and 0.971 for normal and COVID-19 subjects, respectively, demonstrating significant overlap between predicted and reference lung masks. Moreover, MAEs of 0.037 HU and 0.061 HU, relative mean HU difference of -2.679% and -4.403%, and relative volume difference of 2.405% and 5.928% were obtained for normal and COVID-19 subjects, respectively. The comparable performance in lung segmentation of the normal and COVID-19 patients indicates the accuracy of the model for the identification of the lung tissue in the presence of the COVID-19 induced infections (though slightly better performance was observed for normal patients). The promising results achieved by the proposed deep learning-based model demonstrated its reliability in COVID-19 lung segmentation.

Due to faster imaging, less radiation exposure, and being cost-effective CXR is preferred over CT. However, the interpretation of CXR images, compared to CT, is more challenging due to low image resolution and COVID-19 image features being similar to regular pneumonia. Computer-aided diagnosis via deep learning has been investigated to help mitigate these problems and help clinicians during the decision-making process. The requirement for a large amount of labeled data is one of the major problems of deep learning methods when deployed in the medical domain. To provide a solution to this, in this work, we propose a semi-supervised learning (SSL) approach using minimal data for training. We integrate local-phase CXR image features into a multi-feature convolutional neural network architecture where the training of SSL method is obtained with a teacher/student paradigm.

At the time of writing (24 March 2021), over 764,000 cases and over 9,800 deaths by COVID-19 have been confirmed, hospitals were fully occupied with local news reporting at least 397 people in the waiting list for an ICU bed. In an attempt to better inform local policy making, we applied an existing Bayesian algorithm to model the spread of the pandemic in the seven geographic macro-regions of the state. Here we propose changes to extend the model and improve its forecasting capabilities.   Methods: Our four proposed variations of the original method allow accessing data of daily reported infections and take into account under-reporting of cases more explicitly. Two of the proposed versions also attempt to model the delay in test reporting. We simulated weekly forecasting of deaths from the period from 31/05/2020 until 31/01/2021. First week data were used as a cold-start to the algorithm, after which weekly calibrations of the model were able to converge in fewer iterations. Google Mobility data were used as covariates to the model, as well as to estimate of the susceptible population at each simulated run.   Findings: The changes made the model significantly less reactive and more rapid in adapting to scenarios after a peak in deaths is observed. Assuming that the cases are under-reported greatly benefited the model in its stability, and modelling retroactively-added data (due to the \"hot\" nature of the data used) had a negligible impact in performance.   Interpretation: Although not as reliable as death statistics, case statistics, when modelled in conjunction with an overestimate parameter, provide a good alternative for improving the forecasting of models, especially in long-range predictions and after the peak of an infection wave.", "preprint": true}, "139211": {"doi": "empty", "journal": "arxiv", "url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2104.01131v1", "date": "2021-04-02", "title": "Mining Trends of COVID-19 Vaccine Beliefs on Twitter with Lexical Embeddings", "subfield": "Healthcare System", "authors": "Harshita Chopra, Aniket Vashishtha, Ridam Pal, Ashima, Ananya Tyagi, Tavpritesh Sethi", "abstract": "Social media plays a pivotal role in disseminating news across the globe and acts as a platform for people to express their opinions on a variety of topics.

Using unsupervised word embeddings, we tracked the longitudinal change in the latent space of the lexical categories in five countries with strong vaccine roll-out programs, i.e. India, USA, Brazil, UK, and Australia. Nearly 600 thousand vaccine-related tweets from the United States and India were analyzed for an overall understanding of the situation around the world for the time period of 8 months from June 2020 to January 2021.

We demonstrate that negative emotions like hesitancy towards vaccines have a high correlation with health-related effects and misinformation. These associations formed a major module with the highest importance in the network formed for January 2021, when millions of vaccines were administered.

Our paper uses Fall 2019 enrollment data for a medium-sized public American university to analyze whether some student groupings by class standing or course level are more susceptible to the spread of infectious disease through academic enrollment networks. Replicating Weeden and Cornwell [8], we find that enrollment networks at the institution are \"small worlds\" characterized by high clustering, short average path lengths, and multiple independent connections. Connectivity decreases as class standing (graduate vs. undergraduate; senior vs. freshman) and course level increase; as students move from generalized to specialized course loads, networks cluster by major.

There are academic and financial incentives for emphasizing the freshman experience, including concerns about student attrition from the first to second academic year and recouping costs of infrastructure investments in dormitories. Possible solutions could include (i) restricting face-to-face or hybrid instruction to courses in students' academic majors, which would disrupt larger networks into smaller ones and thus restrict the spread of infection across majors, and (ii) take a \"scalpel\" approach to instruction modes by moving online courses most likely to facilitate epidemic spread.", "preprint": true}, "143501": {"doi": "empty", "journal": "arxiv", "url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2104.02477v2", "date": "2021-04-02", "title": "Machine Learning based COVID-19 Detection from Smartphone Recordings: Cough, Breath and Speech", "subfield": "Epidemiology", "authors": "Madhurananda Pahar, Thomas Niesler", "abstract": "We present an experimental investigation into the automatic detection of COVID-19 from smartphone recordings of coughs, breaths and speech.

We investigate both text and multimedia in tweets, building a knowledge graph of syntactic/semantic associations in messages including visual features and indicating how online users framed social discourse mostly around the logistics of vaccine distribution. The English semantic frame of \"vaccine\" was highly polarised between trust/anticipation (towards the vaccine as a scientific asset saving lives) and anger/sadness (mentioning critical issues with dose administering). Semantic associations with \"vaccine,\" \"hoax\" and conspiratorial jargon indicated the persistence of conspiracy theories and vaccines in massively read English posts (absent in Italian messages). The image analysis found that popular tweets with images of people wearing face masks used language lacking the trust and joy found in tweets showing people with no masks, indicating a negative affect attributed to face covering in social discourse. A behavioural analysis revealed a tendency for users to share content eliciting joy, sadness and disgust and to like less sad messages, highlighting an interplay between emotions and content diffusion beyond sentiment. With the AstraZeneca vaccine being suspended in mid March 2021, \"Astrazeneca\" was associated with trustful language driven by experts, but popular Italian tweets framed \"vaccine\" by crucially replacing earlier levels of trust with deep sadness.

Here we offer a stochastic agent-based model to investigate social restriction measures in a community where the feelings of loneliness of the agents dwindle when they are socializing and grow when they are alone. In addition, the intensity of those feelings, which are measured by a real variable that we term degree of loneliness, determines whether the agent will seek social contact or not. We find that decrease of the number, quality or duration of social contacts lead the community to enter a regime of burnout in which the degree of loneliness diverges, although the number of lonely agents at a given moment amounts to only a fraction of the total population. This regime of mental breakdown is separated from the healthy regime, where the degree of loneliness is finite, by a continuous phase transition. We show that the community dynamics is described extremely well by a simple mean-field theory so our conclusions can be easily verified for different scenarios and parameter settings.

To address these issues we first consider mortality modelling in a Bayesian Negative-Binomial framework to account for overdispersion and the uncertainty about the parameter estimates in a natural and coherent way. Model averaging techniques, which consists in combining the predictions of several models, are then considered as a response to model misspecifications.

The objectives of this study were to evaluate the acceptance of the COVID-19 vaccines and examine the factors associated with the acceptance in Bangladesh.   Method: In between January 30 to February 6, 2021, we conducted a web-based anonymous cross-sectional survey among the Bangladeshi general population. The multivariate logistic regression was used to identify the factors that influence the acceptance of the COVID-19 vaccination.   Results: 61.16% (370/605) of the respondents were willing to accept/take the COVID-19 vaccine. Among the accepted group, only 35.14% showed the willingness to take the COVID-19 vaccine immediately, while 64.86% would delay the vaccination until they are confirmed about the vaccine's efficacy and safety or COVID-19 become deadlier in Bangladesh. The regression results showed age, gender, location (urban/rural), level of education, income, perceived risk of being infected with COVID-19 in the future, perceived severity of infection, having previous vaccination experience after age 18, having higher knowledge about COVID-19 and vaccination were significantly associated with the acceptance of COVID-19 vaccines.   Conclusion: The research reported a high prevalence of COVID-19 vaccine refusal and hesitancy in Bangladesh. To diminish the vaccine hesitancy and increase the uptake, the policymakers need to design a well-researched immunization strategy to remove the vaccination barriers.

Consequently, we combine Principal Component Analysis with feature selection methods from several regression-based approaches to identify the main demographic and meteorological drivers behind $R_0$.

Since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, a large number of models have been developed to investigate different aspects of the pandemic. The aim of the present work has been to design and explore a mathematical model of SARS-CoV-2 spread with quarantine fatigue. A deterministic model represented by a system of differential equations, based on Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) dynamics, was developed. The model was explored by means of computational simulations. The results obtained show that, in some scenarios, after a first prevalence peak, fatigue can cause a second peak. Thus, the dynamic behavior of the model suggests that fatigue may have contributed to the production of the second peak of infected people observed in different parts of the world between 2020 and early 2021. The explorations performed also showed that the model is sensitive to infection rate and other parameters related to propagation dynamics.

We study the game-theoretic equilibria that emerge from this setup when the population is composed of either selfish or altruistic individuals. First, we demonstrate that as is typical in these types of games, selfish equilibria are in general not optimal, but that all stable selfish equilibria are within a constant factor of optimal.

Arbeitman, Pablo Rojas, Pedro Ojeda-May, Martin E. Garcia", "abstract": "Most of the ongoing projects aimed at the development of specific therapies and vaccines against COVID-19 use the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein as the main target [1-3]. The binding of the spike protein with the ACE2 receptor (ACE2) of the host cell constitutes the first and key step for virus entry. During this process, the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the S protein plays an essential role, since it contains the receptor binding motif (RBM), responsible for the docking to the receptor. So far, mostly biochemical methods are being tested in order to prevent binding of the virus to ACE2 [4]. Here we show, with the help of atomistic simulations, that external electric fields of easily achievable and moderate strengths can dramatically destabilise the S protein, inducing long-lasting structural damage. One striking field-induced conformational change occurs at the level of the recognition loop L3 of the RBD where two parallel beta sheets, believed to be responsible for a high affinity to ACE2 [5], undergo a change into an unstructured coil, which exhibits almost no binding possibilities to the ACE2 receptor (Figure 1a). Remarkably, while the structural flexibility of S allows the virus to improve its probability of entering the cell, it is also the origin of the surprising vulnerability of S upon application of electric fields of strengths at least two orders of magnitude smaller than those required for damaging most proteins.

An unsupervised rule-based algorithm is then applied to establish relations between concepts in the next step of the pipeline. The extracted concepts and relations are subsequently used to construct two different vector representations of each post.

Several recent studies suggest that a significant number of COVID-19 patients display no physical symptoms whatsoever. Therefore, it is unlikely that these patients will undergo COVID-19 test, which increases their chances of unintentionally spreading the virus. Currently, the primary diagnostic tool to detect COVID-19 is RT-PCR test on collected respiratory specimens from the suspected case. This requires patients to travel to a laboratory facility to be tested, thereby potentially infecting others along the way.It is evident from recent researches that asymptomatic COVID-19 patients cough and breath in a different way than the healthy people. Several research groups have created mobile and web-platform for crowdsourcing the symptoms, cough and breathing sounds from healthy, COVID-19 and Non-COVID patients. Some of these data repositories were made public. We have received such a repository from Cambridge University team under data-sharing agreement, where we have cough and breathing sound samples for 582 and 141 healthy and COVID-19 patients, respectively. 87 COVID-19 patients were asymptomatic, while rest of them have cough. We have developed an Android application to automatically screen COVID-19 from the comfort of people homes. Test subjects can simply download a mobile application, enter their symptoms, record an audio clip of their cough and breath, and upload the data anonymously to our servers. Our backend server converts the audio clip to spectrogram and then apply our state-of-the-art machine learning model to classify between cough sounds produced by COVID-19 patients, as opposed to healthy subjects or those with other respiratory conditions.

New daily Covid-19-hospitalization alone proves a powerful predictor of pandemic EMS calls, with an $r^2$ value equal to 0.85.

Specifically, we present an extension of standard SEIR (susceptible-exposed-infectious-removed) compartmental model, called age-stratified SEAHIR (susceptible-exposedasymptomatic-hospitalized-infectious-removed) model, to capture the spread of COVID-19 over multitype random networks with general degree distributions. We derive several key epidemiological metrics and then propose an age-stratified vaccination strategy to decrease the mortality and hospitalizations. Through extensive study, we discover that the outcome of vaccination prioritization depends on the reproduction number R0. Specifically, the elderly should be prioritized only when R0 is relatively high. If ongoing intervention policies, such as universal masking, could suppress R0 at a relatively low level, prioritizing the high-transmission age group (i.e., adults aged 20-39) is most effective to reduce both mortality and hospitalizations.

Motivated by these attributes and the promise of artificial intelligence tools to aid clinicians, we introduce COVIDx-US, an open-access benchmark dataset of COVID-19 related ultrasound imaging data that is the largest of its kind. The COVIDx-US dataset was curated from multiple sources and consists of 93 lung ultrasound videos and 10,774 processed images of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, non-SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, as well as healthy control cases. The dataset was systematically processed and validated specifically for the purpose of building and evaluating artificial intelligence algorithms and models.", "preprint": true}, "135060": {"doi": "10.1145/3411763.3451768", "journal": "arxiv", "url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2103.12505v1", "date": "2021-03-17", "title": "Towards an Open Global Air Quality Monitoring Platform to Assess Children's Exposure to Air Pollutants in the Light of COVID-19 Lockdowns", "subfield": "Healthcare System", "authors": "Christina Last, Prithviraj Pramanik, Nikita Saini, Akash Smaran Majety, Do-Hyung Kim, Manuel GarcÃ­a-Herranz, Subhabrata Majumdar", "abstract": "This ongoing work attempts to understand and address the requirements of UNICEF, a leading organization working in children's welfare, where they aim to tackle the problem of air quality for children at a global level.

In the Type I right-censoring setting, when the censoring times are completely exogenous, the lower predictive bounds have guaranteed coverage in finite samples without any assumptions other than that of operating on independent and identically distributed data points. Under a more general conditionally independent censoring assumption, the bounds satisfy a doubly robust property which states the following: marginal coverage is approximately guaranteed if either the censoring mechanism or the conditional survival function is estimated well.

We represent the social distancing dichotomously (isolation versus no isolation) and consider lag for isolation from the dates of occurrence of dengue.

To that end, public health authorities intervened aggressively to institute social distancing, lock-down policies, and other Non-Pharmaceutical Interventions (NPIs). Given the high social, educational, psychological, and economic costs of NPIs, authorities tune them, alternatively tightening up or relaxing rules, with the result that, in effect, a relatively flat infection rate results. For example, during the summer in parts of the United States, daily infection numbers dropped to a plateau. This paper approaches NPI tuning as a control-theoretic problem, starting from a simple dynamic model for social distancing based on the classical SIR epidemics model. Using a singular-perturbation approach, the plateau becomes a Quasi-Steady-State (QSS) of a reduced two-dimensional SIR model regulated by adaptive dynamic feedback. It is shown that the QSS can be assigned and it is globally asymptotically stable. Interestingly, the dynamic model for social distancing can be interpreted as a nonlinear integral controller. Problems of data fitting and parameter identifiability are also studied for this model.

Numerous studies have proposed Deep Learning approaches for the automatic diagnosis of COVID-19. Although these methods achieved astonishing performance in detection, they have used limited chest X-ray (CXR) repositories for evaluation, usually with a few hundred COVID-19 CXR images only. Thus, such data scarcity prevents reliable evaluation with the potential of overfitting.

An extensive set of experiments was performed using the state-of-the-art segmentation networks, U-Net, U-Net++, and Feature Pyramid Networks (FPN).

This review study aims to analyze results from past research to understand the interactions among the COVID-19 pandemic, lockdown measures, human mobility, and air quality. The critical review of prior studies indicates that urban form, people's socioeconomic and physical conditions, social cohesion, and social distancing measures significantly affect human mobility and COVID-19 transmission. during the COVID-19 pandemic, many people are inclined to use private transportation for necessary travel purposes to mitigate coronavirus-related health problems.

Here, we describe molecular dynamics simulations to investigate how heparin binds to the spike and the mechanism by which it exerts its antiviral activity. The simulations show that heparin polyanionic chains can bind at long, mostly positively charged patches on the spike, preventing the binding of host cell heparan sulphate proteoglycans to the spike. Heparin can mask both the S1/S2 basic motif, thereby inhibiting furin cleavage and the formation of the prefusion conformation, and the basic residues of the receptor binding domain (RBD), thus acting on the hinge region responsible for the motion of the RBD between inactive closed and active open conformations of the spike. In simulations of the closed spike, heparin binds the RBD and the N-terminal domain of two adjacent spike subunits and hinders the opening. In simulations of the open spike, heparin binds similarly but induces stabilization of the hinge region and a change in RBD motion. Heparin is therefore able to inhibit host cell attachment directly and by two allosteric mechanisms. Furthermore, the simulations provide insights into how heparan sulphate proteoglycans on the host cell can facilitate viral infection.

The rest of the population will instead have access to a less effective vaccine. We apply a large-scale agent-based model of COVID-19 in Australia to investigate the possible implications of this hybrid approach to mass-vaccination. The model is calibrated to recent epidemiological and demographic data available in Australia, and accounts for several components of vaccine efficacy. Within a feasible range of vaccine efficacy values, our model supports the assertion that complete herd immunity due to vaccination is not likely in the Australian context. For realistic scenarios in which herd immunity is not achieved, we simulate the effects of mass-vaccination on epidemic growth rate, and investigate the requirements of lockdown measures applied to curb subsequent outbreaks. In our simulations, Australia's vaccination strategy can feasibly reduce required lockdown intensity and initial epidemic growth rate by 43\\% and 52\\%, respectively. The severity of epidemics, as measured by the peak number of daily new cases, decreases by up to two orders of magnitude under plausible mass-vaccination and lockdown strategies.

For such issues, a common thread of research uses adversarial reactions, e.g., replies pointing out factual inaccuracies in rumors. Though adversarial reactions are prevalent in online conversations, inferring those adverse views (or stance) from the text in replies is difficult and requires complex natural language processing (NLP) models. Moreover, conventional NLP models for stance mining need labeled data for supervised learning. Getting labeled conversations can itself be challenging as conversations can be on any topic, and topics change over time. These challenges make learning the stance a difficult NLP problem.   In this research, we first create a new stance dataset comprised of three different topics by labeling both users' opinions on the topics (as in pro/con) and users' stance while replying to others' posts (as in favor/oppose). As we find limitations with supervised approaches, we propose a weakly-supervised approach to predict the stance in Twitter replies. Our novel method allows using a smaller number of hashtags to generate weak labels for Twitter replies.

A major policy question is whether e-scooters substitute existing mobility options or fill the service gaps left by them. This study addresses this question by analyzing the spatiotemporal patterns of e-scooter service availability and use in Washington DC, focusing on their spatial relationships with public transit and bikesharing. Results from an analysis of three open big datasets suggest that e-scooters have both competing and complementary effects on transit and bikesharing services. The supply of e-scooters significantly overlaps with the service areas of transit and bikesharing, and we classify a majority of e-scooter trips as substitutes to transit and bikesharing uses. A travel-time-based analysis further reveals that when choosing e-scooters over transit, travelers pay a price premium and save some travel time. The price premium is greater during the COVID-19 pandemic but the associated travel-time savings are smaller. This implies that public health considerations rather than time-cost tradeoffs are the main driver for many to choose e-scooters over transit during COVID. In addition, we find that e-scooters complement bikesharing and transit by providing services to underserved neighborhoods. A sizeable proportion (about 10 percent) of e-scooter trips are taken to connect with the rail services.

Although the overall ACE2-binding mode of the SARS-CoV-2 RBD is nearly identical to that of the SARS-CoV RBD, the difference in binding affinity is as large as -16.35 kcal/mol.

Using our age-stratified model and curated epidemiological and vaccination data, we quantified at which pace European countries can lift restrictions without overwhelming their health-care systems. The analysed scenarios range from immediately lifting restriction (accepting high mortality and morbidity) to reducing case numbers until test-trace-and-isolate programs facilitate control. In general, the age-dependent vaccination roll-out implies a transient decrease in the average age of ICU patients and deaths by about seven years. The pace of vaccination determines the speed of lifting restrictions; all scenarios allow to steadily increase contacts starting in May 2021 and relax most restrictions by autumn 2021. Throughout summer, only moderate contact restrictions remain necessary. However, with the assumed vaccination protection, further waves among the unvaccinated population can only be avoided with high vaccine uptake (>90\\%). Strategies that maintain low case numbers instead of high ones reduce infections and deaths by a factor of eight and four. Policies with low case numbers significantly benefit from vaccination, as the overall reduction in susceptibility will further diminish viral spread. Keeping case numbers low is the safest long-term strategy because it i) considerably reduces mortality and morbidity, ii) offers better preparedness against escape virus variants, and iii) allows higher contact numbers (\"freedom\") over the summer.", "preprint": true}, "130681": {"doi": "empty", "journal": "arxiv", "url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2103.06813v1", "date": "2021-03-10", "title": "COVID-19: Optimal Allocation of Ventilator Supply under Uncertainty and Risk", "subfield": "Epidemiology", "authors": "Xuecheng Yin, I.

This epidemiological logistics model involves the uncertainty of untested asymptomatic infections and incorporates short-term human migration. Disease transmission is also forecasted through a new formulation of transmission rates that evolve over space and time with respect to various non-pharmaceutical interventions, such as wearing masks, social distancing, and lockdown. The proposed multi-stage stochastic model overviews different scenarios on the number of asymptomatic individuals while optimizing the distribution of resources, such as ventilators, to minimize the total expected number of newly infected and deceased people. The Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR) is also incorporated into the multi-stage mean-risk model to allow for a trade-off between the weighted expected loss due to the outbreak and the expected risks associated with experiencing disastrous pandemic scenarios. We apply our multi-stage mean-risk epidemics-ventilator-logistics model to the case of controlling the COVID-19 in highly-impacted counties of New York and New Jersey. We calibrate, validate, and test our model using actual infection, population, and migration data. The results indicate that short-term migration influences the transmission of the disease significantly. The optimal number of ventilators allocated to each region depends on various factors, including the number of initial infections, disease transmission rates, initial ICU capacity, the population of a geographical location, and the availability of ventilator supply. Our data-driven modeling framework can be adapted to study the disease transmission dynamics and logistics of other similar epidemics and pandemics.", "preprint": true}, "130680": {"doi": "empty", "journal": "arxiv", "url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2103.06352v1", "date": "2021-03-10", "title": "Identifying ARDS using the Hierarchical Attention Network with Sentence Objectives Framework", "subfield": "Epidemiology", "authors": "Kevin Lybarger, Linzee Mabrey, Matthew Thau, Pavan K.

There is a need to investigate potential adversarial attacks to robustify deep medical diagnosis systems. On the other side, there are several modalities of medical images (e.g., CT, fundus, and endoscopic image) of which each type is significantly different from others. It is more challenging to generate adversarial perturbations for different types of medical images. In this paper, we propose an image-based medical adversarial attack method to consistently produce adversarial perturbations on medical images. The objective function of our method consists of a loss deviation term and a loss stabilization term. The loss deviation term increases the divergence between the CNN prediction of an adversarial example and its ground truth label. Meanwhile, the loss stabilization term ensures similar CNN predictions of this example and its smoothed input. From the perspective of the whole iterations for perturbation generation, the proposed loss stabilization term exhaustively searches the perturbation space to smooth the single spot for local optimum escape. We further analyze the KL-divergence of the proposed loss function and find that the loss stabilization term makes the perturbations updated towards a fixed objective spot while deviating from the ground truth. This stabilization ensures the proposed medical attack effective for different types of medical images while producing perturbations in small variance.

Several R-packages are currently available to deal with spatiotemporal areal count data. Each package focuses on different models and/or statistical methodologies. Unfortunately, the results generated by these models are rarely comparable due to differences in notation and methods. The main objective of this paper is to present a review describing the most important approaches that can be used to model and analyse count data when questions of scientific interest concern both their spatial and their temporal behaviour and we monitor their performance under the same data set.   For this review, we focus on the three R-packages that can be used for this purpose and the different models assessed are representative of the two most widespread methodologies used to analyse spatiotemporal count data: the classical approach (based on Penalised Likelihood or Estimating Equations) and the Bayesian point of view.   A case study is analysed as an illustration of these different methodologies.

To address this question, we develop a mathematical model of COVID-19 spread incorporating both vaccine dynamics and socio-epidemiological parameters. We use this model to study two important measures of disease control and eradication, the effective reproductive number $R_t$ and the peak intensive care unit (ICU) caseload, over three key parameters: social measure adherence, vaccination rate, and vaccination coverage. Our results suggest that, due to the slow pace of vaccine administration, social measures must be maintained by a large proportion of the population until a sufficient proportion of the population becomes vaccinated for the pandemic to be eradicated. By contrast, with reduced adherence to social measures, hospital ICU cases will greatly exceed capacity, resulting in increased avoidable loss of life.

The use of base classifiers within an ensemble allows our system to identify the pneumonia patterns regardless of their size or location.

In addition to learning transferable features via domain-adversarial training, we propose a novel task semantic adaptor that uses the learning-to-learn strategy to adapt the task semantics. Experiments on three public COVID-19 datasets demonstrate that our proposed method achieves superior performance.

Later waves of COVID-19 infections in late 2020 and corresponding lockdowns have caused further CO$_2$ emissions reductions particularly in western countries, but to a much smaller extent than the declines in the first wave. That even substantial world-wide lockdowns of activity led to a one-time decline in global CO$_2$ emissions of only 5.4% in one year highlights the significant challenges for climate change mitigation that we face in the post-COVID era.

Mathematical models can contribute to further understanding these phenomena by obtaining analytical solutions as well as numerical simulations. In this study, an NPI was introduced into the SIR model for a conceptual study of infectious diseases under the condition that the transmission rate was reduced to a fixed value only once within a finite time duration, and its effect was analyzed numerically and theoretically.

A point of particular interest is the potential contribution of a more wide-spread use of screening tests based on lateral flow devices. We compare policies both with respect to their potential to contain new outbreaks of Covid-19 in schools and the proportion of schooldays lost due to isolation of pupils. We find that regular asymptomatic screening of the whole school as an addition to a policy built around isolation of symptomatic pupils and their closest contacts is beneficial across a wide range of scenarios, including when screening tests with relatively low test sensitivity are used.

How to best restrict travel, however, is unclear. Most studies and policies simply constrain the distance r individuals may travel from their home or neighbourhood. However, the epidemic risk is related not only to distance travelled, but also to frequency of contacts, which is proxied by the frequency f with which individuals revisit locations over a given reference period. Inspired by recent literature that uncovers a clear universality pattern on how r and f interact in routine human mobility, this paper addresses the following question: does this universal relation between r and f carry over to epidemic spreading, so that the risk associated with human movement can be modeled by a single, unifying variable r * f? To answer this question, we use two large-scale datasets of individual human mobility to simulate disease spread. Results show that a universal relation between r and f indeed exists in the context of epidemic spread: in both of the datasets, the final size and the spatial distribution of the infected population depends on the product r * f more directly than on the individual values of r and f. The important implication here is that restricting r (where you can go), but not f (how frequently), could be unproductive: high frequency trips to nearby locations can be as dangerous for disease spread as low frequency trips to distant locations.

A slightly higher share is detected for the most severely affected areas (the provinces of Bergamo and Brescia, in particular), but even in these territories, the harvesting effect can only account for less than 20% of excess deaths.

Combining estimates from multiple models to better understand the variation of these outcome measures is important to help inform decision making. We incorporate estimates of these outcome measures from a number of candidate models for specific UK nations/regions using meta analysis. Random effects models have been implemented to accommodate differing modelling approaches and assumptions between candidate models. Restricted maximum likelihood (REML) is used to estimate the heterogeneity variance parameter, with two approaches to calculate the confidence interval for the combined effect: standard Wald-type intervals and the Knapp and Hartung (KNHA) method. Approaches using REML alone and REML+KNHA provided similar ranges of variation for $R(t)$ and $r$. However, differences were observed when combining estimates on $I$, with the REML+KNHA approach providing more conservative confidence intervals. This is likely due to the limited number of candidate models contributing estimates for this outcome measure, coupled with the large variability observed between model estimates. Utilising these meta-analysis techniques has allowed for statistically robust combined estimates to be calculated for key COVID-19 outcome measures, allowing an overall assessment of the current response measures with associated uncertainty.

In the past, they have been tried on time-series forecasting as well, but their overall results have not been significantly better than the statistical models especially for intermediate length times series data. Their modeling capacities are limited in cases where enough data may not be available to estimate the large number of parameters that these non-linear models require.

Our method, Augmented-Neural-Network, which involves using forecasts from statistical models, can help unlock the power of neural networks on intermediate length time-series and produces competitive results. It shows that data augmentation, when paired with Automated Machine Learning techniques such as Neural Architecture Search, can help to find the best neural architecture for a given time-series.

By analyzing the mutation-induced hydrophobic surface changes in the attraction and repulsion at the binding site of the complexes of the SARS-CoV-2 variants and antibodies, we found out that all the mutations of N501Y, E484K, K417N and L452R can selectively decrease or increase their binding affinity with some antibodies.", "preprint": true}, "129980": {"doi": "empty", "journal": "arxiv", "url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2103.05562v1", "date": "2021-02-28", "title": "MirrorME: Implementation of an IoT based Smart Mirror through Facial Recognition and Personalized Information Recommendation Algorithm", "subfield": "Healthcare System", "authors": "Khandaker Mohammad Mohi Uddin, Samrat Kumar Dey, Gias Uddin Parvez, Ayesha Siddika Mukta, Uzzal Kumar Acharjee", "abstract": "We are living in the era of the fourth industrial revolution, which also treated as 4IR or Industry 4.0.

However, high incidence rates and rapidly spreading SARS-CoV-2 variants are concerning. In combination with acute supply deficits in Europe in early 2021, the question arises of whether stretching the vaccine, for instance by delaying the second dose, can make a significant contribution to preventing deaths, despite associated risks such as lower vaccine efficacy, the potential emergence of escape mutants, enhancement, waning immunity, reduced social acceptance of off-label vaccination, and liability shifts. A quantitative epidemiological assessment of risks and benefits of non-standard vaccination protocols remains elusive. To clarify the situation and to provide a quantitative epidemiological foundation we develop a stochastic epidemiological model that integrates specific vaccine rollout protocols into a risk-group structured infectious disease dynamical model. Using the situation and conditions in Germany as a reference system, we show that delaying the second vaccine dose is expected to prevent deaths in the four to five digit range, should the incidence resurge. We show that this considerable public health benefit relies on the fact that both mRNA vaccines provide substantial protection against severe COVID-19 and death beginning 12 to 14 days after the first dose. The benefits of protocol change are attenuated should vaccine compliance decrease substantially. To quantify the impact of protocol change on vaccination adherence we performed a large-scale online survey.

Thus, setting up strategies of vaccination became crucial to control the COVID19 pandemic. Methods: We use daily COVID-19 reports from Chicago and NYC from 01-Mar2020 to 28- Nov-2020 to estimate the parameters of an SEIR-like epidemiological model that accounts for different severity levels. To achieve data adherent predictions, we let the model parameters to be time-dependent. The model is used to forecast different vaccination scenarios, where the campaign starts at different dates, from 01-Oct-2020 to 01-Apr-2021. To generate realistic scenarios, disease control strategies are implemented whenever the number of predicted daily hospitalizations reaches a preset threshold. Results: The model reproduces the empirical data with remarkable accuracy. Delaying the vaccination severely affects the mortality, hospitalization, and recovery projections. In Chicago, the disease spread was under control, reducing the mortality increment as the start of the vaccination was postponed. In NYC, the number of cases was increasing, thus, the estimated model predicted a much larger impact, despite the implementation of contention measures. The earlier the vaccination campaign begins, the larger is its potential impact in reducing the COVID-19 cases, as well as in the hospitalizations and deaths.

Next, we adopt three vertex centrality measurements over the contact graphs to generate three groups of superspreader candidates.

They change over the first few weeks of a semester, but stabilize throughout the rest of the term. The data also demonstrate that both symmetric and asymmetric contact tracing can discover superspreaders, but the latter performs better with daily contact graphs.

Without this correction, raw data will often mislead by suggesting an improving situation.

Several theories have been proposed to explain these facts. In particular, it was proposed that the lower expression of the viral receptor ACE2 in children protects them from severe Covid. However, other works suggested an inverse relationship between ACE2 expression and disease severity. Here we try to reconcile seemingly contradicting observations noting that ACE2 is not monotonically related with age but it reaches a maximum at a young age that depends on the cell type and then decreases. This pattern is consistent with most existing data from humans and rodents and it is expected to be more marked for ACE2 cell protein than for mRNA because of the increase with age of the protease TACE/ADAM17 that sheds ACE2 from the cell membrane to the serum. The negative relation between ACE2 level and Covid-19 severity at old age is not paradoxical but it is consistent with a mathematical model of virus propagation that predicts that higher viral receptor does not necessarily favour virus propagation and it can even slow it down. More importantly, ACE2 is known to protect organs from chronic and acute inflammation, which are worsened by low ACE2 levels. Here we propose that ACE2 contributes essentially to reverse the inflammatory process by downregulating the pro-inflammatory peptides of the angiotensin and bradykinin system, and that failure to revert the inflammation triggered by SARS-COV-2 may underlie both severe CoViD-19 infection and its many post-infection manifestations, including the multi-inflammatory syndrome of children (MIS-C). Within this view, lower severity in children despite lower ACE2 expression may be consistent with their higher expression of the alternative angiotensin II receptor ATR2 and in general of the anti-inflammatory arm of the Renin-Angiotensin System (RAS) at young age.", "preprint": true}, "123264": {"doi": "empty", "journal": "arxiv", "url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.10538v1", "date": "2021-02-21", "title": "Policy-Aware Mobility Model Explains the Growth of COVID-19 in Cities", "subfield": "Mortality", "authors": "Zhenyu Han, Fengli Xu, Yong Li, Tao Jiang, Depeng Jin, Jianhua Lu, James A.

Predictions must take into account non-pharmaceutical interventions to slow the spread of coronavirus, including stay-at-home orders, social distancing, quarantine and compulsory mask-wearing, leading to reductions in intra-city mobility and viral transmission. Moreover, recent work associating coronavirus with human mobility and detailed movement data suggest the need to consider urban mobility in disease forecasts. Here we show that by incorporating intra-city mobility and policy adoption into a novel metapopulation SEIR model, we can accurately predict complex COVID-19 growth patterns in U.S. cities ($R^2$ = 0.990). Estimated mobility change due to policy interventions is consistent with empirical observation from Apple Mobility Trends Reports (Pearson's R = 0.872), suggesting the utility of model-based predictions where data are limited. Our model also reproduces urban \"superspreading\", where a few neighborhoods account for most secondary infections across urban space, arising from uneven neighborhood populations and heightened intra-city churn in popular neighborhoods.

Super-resolution (SR), in the past few years, has produced remarkable results using deep learning methods. The ability of deep learning methods to learn the non-linear mapping from low-resolution (LR) images to their corresponding high-resolution (HR) images leads to compelling results for SR in diverse areas of research. In this paper, we propose a deep learning based image super-resolution architecture in Tchebichef transform domain. This is achieved by integrating a transform layer into the proposed architecture through a customized Tchebichef convolutional layer ($TCL$). The role of TCL is to convert the LR image from the spatial domain to the orthogonal transform domain using Tchebichef basis functions. The inversion of the aforementioned transformation is achieved using another layer known as the Inverse Tchebichef convolutional Layer (ITCL), which converts back the LR images from the transform domain to the spatial domain. It has been observed that using the Tchebichef transform domain for the task of SR takes the advantage of high and low-frequency representation of images that makes the task of super-resolution simplified. We, further, introduce transfer learning approach to enhance the quality of Covid based medical images. It is shown that our architecture enhances the quality of X-ray and CT images of COVID-19, providing a better image quality that helps in clinical diagnosis.

However, traditional models are too simplistic to investigate complex, non-linear relationships and suffer from some restrictions. Therefore, we employed copula models to examine the impact of high temperatures on virus transmission. The findings from the copula models showed that there was a weak to moderate effect of temperature on the number of infections and the effect almost vanished under a lockdown policy. Therefore, this study provides new insight into the relationship between COVID-19 and temperature, both with and without social isolation practices. Such results can lead to improvements in our understanding of this new virus. In particular, the results derived from the copula models examined here, unlike existing traditional models, provide evidence that there is no substantial influence of high temperatures on the active COVID-19 outbreak situation.

Our debiased panel data regression analysis with a set of county dummies, interactions of state and week dummies, and other controls shows that an increase in visits to both K-12 schools and colleges is associated with a subsequent increase in case growth rates.

The results suggest that in the absence of the sanitary measures, the cumulative number of infections, hospitalizations, and deaths would have been at least twice the official number.

This is being observed firsthand during the current COVID-19 crisis, as novel mutations challenge our global vaccination race. To address this, we introduce here a general framework to model epidemic spreading under pathogen evolution, finding that mutations can fundamentally alter the projection of the spread. Specifically, we detect a new pandemic phase - the mutated phase - in which, despite the fact that the pathogen is initially non-pandemic (R0 < 1), it may still spread due to the emergence of a critical mutation. The boundaries of this phase portray a balance between the epidemic and the evolutionary time-scales. If the mutation rate is too low, the pathogen prevalence decays prior to the appearance of a critical mutation. On the other hand, if mutations are too rapid, the pathogen evolution becomes volatile and, once again, it fails to spread. Between these two extremes, however, we observe a broad range of conditions in which an initially sub-pandemic pathogen will eventually gain prevalence. This is especially relevant during vaccination, which creates, as it progresses, increasing selection pressure towards vaccine-resistance. To overcome this, we show that vaccination campaigns must be accompanied by fierce mitigation efforts, to suppress the potential rise of a resistant mutant strain.", "preprint": true}, "144937": {"doi": "empty", "journal": "arxiv", "url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.09507v2", "date": "2021-02-18", "title": "Regular Expressions for Fast-response COVID-19 Text Classification", "subfield": "Epidemiology", "authors": "Igor L.

There is a growing need to make their rich content discoverable to information retrieval tools. In this paper, we present a novel approach to document structure recovery in PDF using recurrent neural networks to process the low-level PDF data representation directly, instead of relying on a visual re-interpretation of the rendered PDF page, as has been proposed in previous literature. We demonstrate how a sequence of PDF printing commands can be used as input into a neural network and how the network can learn to classify each printing command according to its structural function in the page. This approach has three advantages: First, it can distinguish among more fine-grained labels (typically 10-20 labels as opposed to 1-5 with visual methods), which results in a more accurate and detailed document structure resolution. Second, it can take into account the text flow across pages more naturally compared to visual methods because it can concatenate the printing commands of sequential pages. Last, our proposed method needs less memory and it is computationally less expensive than visual methods. This allows us to deploy such models in production environments at a much lower cost. Through extensive architectural search in combination with advanced feature engineering, we were able to implement a model that yields a weighted average F1 score of 97% across 17 distinct structural labels. The best model we achieved is currently served in production environments on our Corpus Conversion Service (CCS), which was presented at KDD18 (arXiv:1806.02284).

In this study, we address capacity planning decisions of a hemodialysis clinic located within a major hospital in Istanbul, designated to serve both infected and uninfected patients during the pandemic with limited resources (i.e., dialysis machines). The hemodialysis clinic applies a three-unit cohorting strategy to treat four types of patients in separate units and at different times to mitigate infection spread risk among patients. Accordingly, at the beginning of each week, the clinic needs to determine the number of available dialysis machines to allocate to each unit that serves different patient cohorts. Given the uncertainties in the number of different types of patients that will need dialysis, it is a challenge to allocate the scarce dialysis resources effectively by evaluating which capacity configuration would minimize the overlapping treatment sessions of infected and uninfected patients over a week.

It is also significantly simpler and more tractable than semi-Markov models with a similar level of generality. Based on the notion of stochastic stability, we derive a sufficient condition for a shrinking epidemic in terms of the queuing system's occupation rate that drives the dynamics. Relying on this condition, we propose a class of ad-hoc stabilising mitigation strategies that seek to keep a balanced occupation rate after a prescribed mitigation-free period. We validate the approach in the light of recent data on the COVID-19 epidemic and assess the effect of different stabilising strategies. The results suggest that it is possible to curb the epidemic with various occupation rate levels, as long as the mitigation is not excessively procrastinated.", "preprint": true}, "121675": {"doi": "empty", "journal": "arxiv", "url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.08128v1", "date": "2021-02-16", "title": "Quantitative analysis of image quality in low-dose CT imaging for Covid-19 patients", "subfield": "Epidemiology", "authors": "Behrooz Ghane, Alireza Karimian, Samaneh Mostafapour, Faezeh Gholamiankhak, Seyedjafar Shojaerazavi, Hossein Arabi", "abstract": "We set out to simulate four reduced dose-levels (60%-dose, 40%-dose, 20%-dose, and 10%-dose) of standard CT imaging using Beer-Lambert's law across 49 patients infected with COVID-19.

This is now especially relevant since e.g. periocular verification is contactless, and thereby safe to use in pandemics such as COVID-19. However, selfie-based biometrics faces some challenges since there is limited control over the data acquisition conditions. Therefore, super-resolution has to be used to increase the quality of the captured images. Most of the state of the art super-resolution methods use deep networks with large filters, thereby needing to train and store a correspondingly large number of parameters, and making their use difficult for mobile devices commonly used for selfie-based.   In order to achieve an efficient super-resolution method, we propose an Efficient Single Image Super-Resolution (ESISR) algorithm, which takes into account a trade-off between the efficiency of the deep neural network and the size of its filters. To that end, the method implements a novel loss function based on the Sharpness metric. This metric turns out to be more suitable for increasing the quality of the eye images.

One proposed solution is to normalise yearly publication rates by field size, but this is arduous and difficult. Here, we propose an simpler index that normalises keywords of interest by a ubiquitous and innocuous keyword, such as \"banana\". Alternatively, one could opt for field-specific keywords or hierarchical structures (e.g. PubMed's Medical Subject Headings, MeSH) to compute \"interest market share\". Using this approach, we uncovered plausible trends in academic interest in examples from the medical literature. In neuroimaging, we found that not the supplementary motor area (as was previously claimed), but the prefrontal cortex is the most interesting part of the brain. In cancer research, we found a contemporary preference for cancers with high prevalence and clinical severity, and notable declines in interest for more treatable or likely benign neoplasms. Finally, we found that interest in respiratory viral infections spiked when strains showed potential for pandemic involvement, with SARS-CoV-2 and the COVID-19 pandemic being the most extreme example.

Methods. In this paper, we present a comparative analysis of various ML approaches including Support Vector Machine, Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbor and Artificial Neural Network in predicting the COVID-19 outbreak in the epidemiological domain. We first apply the autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) method to identify and model the short and long-run relationships of the time-series COVID-19 datasets. That is, we determine the lags between a response variable and its respective explanatory time series variables as independent variables. Then, the resulting significant variables concerning their lags are used in the regression model selected by the ARDL for predicting and forecasting the trend of the epidemic. Results. Statistical measures i.e., Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) are used for model accuracy. The values of MAPE for the best selected models for confirmed, recovered and deaths cases are 0.407, 0.094 and 0.124 respectively, which falls under the category of highly accurate forecasts.

The problem is challenged further in the unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) setting where we only have access to labeled samples in the source domain, but desire selecting a model that achieves good performance on a target domain for which only unlabeled samples are available. Existing techniques for UDA model selection are designed for the predictive setting. These methods examine discriminative density ratios between the input covariates in the source and target domain and do not factor in the model's predictions in the target domain. Because of this, two models with identical performance on the source domain would receive the same risk score by existing methods, but in reality, have significantly different performance in the test domain. We leverage the invariance of causal structures across domains to propose a novel model selection metric specifically designed for ITE methods under the UDA setting.

In this work, we take the early steps to address these challenges using Knowledge Infused Policy Gradient (KIPG) methods. Prior work on knowledge infusion does not handle soft and hard imposition of varying forms of knowledge in disease information and guidelines to necessarily comply with. Furthermore, the models do not attend to non-homogeneity in feature counts, manifesting as partial observability in informing the policy. Additionally, interpretable structures are extracted post-learning instead of learning an interpretable model required for APC. To this end, we introduce a mathematical framework for KIPG methods that can (a) induce relevant feature counts over multi-relational features of the world, (b) handle latent non-homogeneous counts as hidden variables that are linear combinations of kernelized aggregates over the features, and (b) infuse knowledge as functional constraints in a principled manner.

In this paper we propose a dilated dual attention U-Net (D2A U-Net) for COVID-19 lesion segmentation in CT slices based on dilated convolution and a novel dual attention mechanism to address the issues above. We introduce a dilated convolution module in model decoder to achieve large receptive field, which refines decoding process and contributes to segmentation accuracy. Also, we present a dual attention mechanism composed of two attention modules which are inserted to skip connection and model decoder respectively. The dual attention mechanism is utilized to refine feature maps and reduce semantic gap between different levels of the model. The proposed method has been evaluated on open-source dataset and outperforms cutting edges methods in semantic segmentation. Our proposed D2A U-Net with pretrained encoder achieves a Dice score of 0.7298 and recall score of 0.7071. Besides, we also build a simplified D2A U-Net without pretrained encoder to provide a fair comparison with other models trained from scratch, which still outperforms popular U-Net family models with a Dice score of 0.7047 and recall score of 0.6626. Our experiment results have shown that by introducing dilated convolution and dual attention mechanism, the number of false positives is significantly reduced, which improves sensitivity to COVID-19 lesions and subsequently brings significant increase to Dice score.", "preprint": true}, "144946": {"doi": "empty", "journal": "arxiv", "url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.05470v2", "date": "2021-02-10", "title": "Dark Web Marketplaces and COVID-19: The vaccines", "subfield": "Healthcare System", "authors": "Alberto Bracci, Matthieu Nadini, Maxwell Aliapoulios, Damon McCoy, Ian Gray, Alexander Teytelboym, Angela Gallo, Andrea Baronchelli", "abstract": "The ongoing COVID-19 vaccination campaign has so far targeted less than 3% of the world population, and even in countries where the campaign has started many citizens will not receive their doses for many months.

Strict mask-wearing policies have been met with not only public sensation but also practical difficulty. We cannot hope to manually check if everyone on a street is wearing a mask properly.

We find that NO2 concentrations increase on planets around cooler stars due to less short-wavelength photons that can photolyze NO2.

To stave off the spread of the virus, the authorities in the US, employed different strategies including the mask mandate (MM) order issued by the states' governors. Although most of the previous studies pointed in the direction that MM can be effective in hindering the spread of viral infections, the effectiveness of MM in reducing the degree of exposure to the virus and, consequently, death rates remains indeterminate. Indeed, the extent to which the degree of exposure to COVID-19 takes part in the lethality of the virus remains unclear. In the current work, we defined a parameter called the average death ratio as the monthly average of the ratio of the number of daily deaths to the total number of daily cases. We utilized survey data provided by New York Times to quantify people's abidance to the MM order. Additionally, we implicitly addressed the extent to which people abide by the MM order that may depend on some parameters like population, income, and political inclination. Using different machine learning classification algorithms we investigated how the decrease or increase in death ratio for the counties in the US West Coast correlates with the input parameters. Our results showed a promising score as high as 0.94 with algorithms like XGBoost, Random Forest, and Naive Bayes.

A vaccine credential can also provide information such as an individual's Covid-19 vaccination history and adverse symptom reaction history to judge their potential impact on the overall health of individuals within densely packed public locations and workspaces. After completing the comparisons, we believe a card-based implementation will benefit regions with less socioeconomic mobility, limited resources, and stagnant administrations.

We introduce an aggregate Contact Exposure Index (CEI) to measure exposure due to this interpersonal contact and combine it with social distancing metrics to show its effect on positive case growth.

Using the CEI, schools and restaurants are identified as high-exposure industries, and the estimation suggests that implementing specific mobility restrictions on these point-of-interest categories are most effective.

To gain effective control of the pandemic, decision-makers in developing countries, particularly those with large populations, must overcome difficulties posed by an unequal distribution of wealth combined with low daily testing capacities. The economic infrastructure of the country, often concentrated in a few cities, forces workers to travel from commuter cities and rural areas, which induces strong nonlinear effects on disease transmission.

The strategy uses readily available anonymised mobility and demographic data integrated with intensive care unit (ICU) occupancy data and city-specific social-distancing measures. Taking into account the heterogeneity of ICU bed occupancy in differing regions and the stages of disease evolution, we use a data-driven study of the Brazilian state of Sao Paulo as an example to show that smart testing strategies can rapidly limit transmission while reducing the need for social-distancing measures, thus returning life to a so-called new normal, even when testing capacity is limited.", "preprint": true}, "119013": {"doi": "empty", "journal": "arxiv", "url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.03836v1", "date": "2021-02-07", "title": "Metastable states in plateaus and multi-wave epidemic dynamics of Covid-19 spreading in Italy", "subfield": "Mortality", "authors": "Gaetano Campi, Maria Vittoria Mazziotti, Antonio Valletta, Giampietro Ravagnan, Augusto Marcelli, Andrea Perali, Antonio Bianconi", "abstract": "The control of Covid 19 epidemics by public health policy in Italy during the first and the second epidemic waves has been driven by using reproductive number Rt(t) to identify the supercritical (percolative), the subcritical (arrested), separated by the critical regime.

For instance, in handling pandemic diseases such as the recent Covid-19 outbreak and other outbreaks like Ebola, robots can assist in reaching areas dangerous for humans and do simple tasks such as pick up the correct medicine (among a set of bottles prescribed) and deliver to patients. In such cases, it might not be good to rely on the fully autonomous operation of robots. Since many mobile robots are fully functional with low-level tasks such as grabbing and moving, we consider the mixed-initiative control where the user can guide the robot remotely to finish such tasks. For this mixed-initiative control, the user controlling the robot needs to visualize a 3D scene as seen by the robot and guide it. Mixed reality can virtualize reality and immerse users in the 3D scene that is reconstructed from the real-world environment. This technique provides the user more freedom such as choosing viewpoints at view time. In recent years, benefiting from the high-quality data from Light Detection and Ranging (LIDAR) and RGBD cameras, mixed reality is widely used to build networked platforms to improve the performance of robot teleoperations and robot-human collaboration, and enhanced feedback for mixed-initiative control.

I show that while Merton's norms and his intertwinement of these with the underlying mechanisms of democratic order provide us with an especially good starting point to explore and clarify the commitments and values of science, Leonelli's broader, more context-responsive, and more holistic vision of the epistemic integrity of data scientific understanding, and her discernment of the global and biospheric scope of its moral-practical reach, move beyond Merton's schema in ways that effectively draw upon important critiques.

Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) offer an excellent solution for face recognition and classification of correct mask wearing and positioning. In the context of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, such algorithms can be used at entrances to corporate buildings, airports, shopping areas, and other indoor locations, to mitigate the spread of the virus. These application scenarios impose major challenges to the underlying compute platform. The inference hardware must be cheap, small and energy efficient, while providing sufficient memory and compute power to execute accurate CNNs at a reasonably low latency. To maintain data privacy of the public, all processing must remain on the edge-device, without any communication with cloud servers. To address these challenges, we present a low-power binary neural network classifier for correct facial-mask wear and positioning.

Classification can take place at up to ~6400 frames-per-second, easily enabling multi-camera, speed-gate settings or statistics collection in crowd settings.

With a limited number of daily COVID19 tests performed in every country, simulating the COVID-19 spread along with the potential effect of each mitigation strategy currently remains one of the most effective ways in managing the healthcare system and guiding policy-makers. We introduce COVIDHunter, a flexible and accurate COVID-19 outbreak simulation model that evaluates the current mitigation measures that are applied to a region and provides suggestions on what strength the upcoming mitigation measure should be. The key idea of COVIDHunter is to quantify the spread of COVID-19 in a geographical region by simulating the average number of new infections caused by an infected person considering the effect of external factors, such as environmental conditions (e.g., climate, temperature, humidity) and mitigation measures.   Results: Using Switzerland as a case study, COVIDHunter estimates that the policy-makers need to keep the current mitigation measures for at least 30 days to prevent demand from quickly exceeding existing hospital capacity. Relaxing the mitigation measures by 50% for 30 days increases both the daily capacity need for hospital beds and daily number of deaths exponentially by an average of 23.8x, who may occupy ICU beds and ventilators for a period of time. Unlike existing models, the COVIDHunter model accurately monitors and predicts the daily number of cases, hospitalizations, and deaths due to COVID-19. Our model is flexible to configure and simple to modify for modeling different scenarios under different environmental conditions and mitigation measures.

We have carried out a detailed mathematical analysis of the CoVCom9, including the derivation of the basic reproduction number, $\\mathcal{R}_{0}$. In particular, we have shown that the disease-free equilibrium is globally asymptotically stable when $\\mathcal{R}_{0}<1$ via a candidate Lyapunov function. Using the SARS-CoV-2 reported data for confirmed-positive cases and deaths from March 13 to August 10, 2020, we have parametrised the CoVCom9 model. The results of this fit show good agreement with data. We used Latin hypercube sampling-rank correlation coefficient (LHS-PRCC) to investigate the uncertainty and sensitivity of $\\mathcal{R}_{0}$ since the results derived are significant in controlling the spread of SARS-CoV-2. We estimate that over this five month period, the basic reproduction number is given by $\\mathcal{R}_{0} = 3.110$, with the 95\\% confidence interval being $2.042 \\leq \\mathcal{R}_0 \\leq 3.240$, and the mean value being $\\mathcal{R}_{0}=2.623$. Of the 32 parameters in the model, we find that just six have a significant influence on $\\mathcal{R}_{0}$, these include the rate of testing, where an increasing testing rate contributes to the reduction of $\\mathcal{R}_{0}$.", "preprint": true}, "116843": {"doi": "empty", "journal": "arxiv", "url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.03253v1", "date": "2021-02-05", "title": "Analyzing Host-Viral Interactome of SARS-CoV-2 for Identifying Vulnerable Host Proteins during COVID-19 Pathogenesis", "subfield": "Vaccination", "authors": "Jayanta Kumar Das, Swarup Roy, Pietro Hiram Guzzi", "abstract": "The development of therapeutic targets for COVID-19 treatment is based on the understanding of the molecular mechanism of pathogenesis. The identification of genes and proteins involved in the infection mechanism is the key to shed out light into the complex molecular mechanisms. The combined effort of many laboratories distributed throughout the world has produced the accumulation of both protein and genetic interactions. In this work we integrate these available results and we obtain an host protein-protein interaction network composed by 1432 human proteins. We calculate network centrality measures to identify key proteins. Then we perform functional enrichment of central proteins. We observed that the identified proteins are mostly associated with several crucial pathways, including cellular process, signalling transduction, neurodegenerative disease. Finally, we focused on proteins involved in causing disease in the human respiratory tract. We conclude that COVID19 is a complex disease, and we highlighted many potential therapeutic targets including RBX1, HSPA5, ITCH, RAB7A, RAB5A, RAB8A, PSMC5, CAPZB, CANX, IGF2R, HSPA1A, which are central and also associated with multiple diseases", "preprint": true}, "119016": {"doi": "empty", "journal": "arxiv", "url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.03373v2", "date": "2021-02-05", "title": "A modelling study across the Italian regions: Lockdown, testing strategy, colored zones, and skew-normal distributions.

Lessons from the first experience should be useful to avoid indiscriminate closures and, above all, to determine universal (understandable) parameters to guide the introduction of containment measures to reduce the spreading of the virus. The use of few (effective) parameters is indeed of extreme importance to create a link between authorities and population, allowing the latter to understand the reason for some restrictions and, consequently, to allow an active participation in the fight against the pandemic.   Testing strategies, fitting skew parameters (as mean, mode, standard deviation, and skewness), mortality rates, and weekly CoViD-19 spreading data, as more people are getting infected, were used to compare the first wave of the outbreak in the Italian regions and to determine which parameters have to be checked before introducing restrictive containment measures.

Yet a little known that there is also a low carbon shift of the global energy system in 2020. Here, using the near-real-time data on energy-related GHG emissions from 30 countries (about 70% of global power generation), we show that the pandemic caused an unprecedented de-carbonization of global power system, representing by a dramatic decrease in the carbon intensity of power sector that reached a historical low of 414.9 tCO2eq/GWh in 2020. Moreover, the share of energy derived from renewable and low-carbon sources (nuclear, hydro-energy, wind, solar, geothermal, and biomass) exceeded that from coal and oil for the first time in history in May of 2020. The decrease in global net energy demand (-1.3% in the first half of 2020 relative to the average of the period in 2016-2019) masks a large down-regulation of fossil-fuel-burning power plants supply (-6.1%) coincident with a surge of low-carbon sources (+6.2%). Concomitant changes in the diurnal cycle of electricity demand also favored low-carbon generators, including a flattening of the morning ramp, a lower midday peak, and delays in both the morning and midday load peaks in most countries. However, emission intensities in the power sector have since rebounded in many countries, and a key question for climate mitigation is thus to what extent countries can achieve and maintain lower, pandemic-level carbon intensities of electricity as part of a green recovery.", "preprint": true}, "119019": {"doi": "empty", "journal": "arxiv", "url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.02381v1", "date": "2021-02-04", "title": "Tilted Nonparametric Regression Function Estimation", "subfield": "Epidemiology", "authors": "Farzaneh Boroumand, Mohammad T.

We also present an extensive numerical study for analysing the performance of two members of the tilted linear smoother class named tilted Nadaraya-Watson and tilted local linear in the finite sample. The simulation study shows that tilted Nadaraya-Watson and tilted local linear perform better than their classical analogs in some conditions in terms of Mean Integrated Squared Error (MISE).

Minimizing malignant online influences is therefore crucial to securing their assent for policies ranging from vaccinations, masks and social distancing against the pandemic, to household best practices against climate change, to acceptance of future 5G towers nearby. Here we show how a strengthening of bonds across online communities during the pandemic, has led to non-Covid-19 conspiracy theories (e.g. fluoride, chemtrails, 5G) attaining heightened access to mainstream parent communities. Alternative health communities act as the critical conduits between conspiracy theorists and parents, and make the narratives more palatable to the latter. We demonstrate experimentally that these inter-community bonds can perpetually generate new misinformation, irrespective of any changes in factual information. Our findings show explicitly why Facebook's current policies have failed to stop the mainstreaming of non-Covid-19 and Covid-19 conspiracy theories and misinformation, and why targeting the largest communities will not work. A simple yet exactly solvable and empirically grounded mathematical model, shows how modest tailoring of mainstream communities' couplings could prevent them from tipping against establishment guidance.

We, therefore, start by focusing on understanding what the state-of-the-art approaches lack -- since the problem remains, this is a fair assumption. We find concerning issues within the current literature and follow a diverging path. Notably, by placing emphasis on using data features that are less susceptible to malicious manipulation and also on looking for high-level approaches that avoid a granularity level that is biased towards easy-to-spot and low impact cases.   We designed and implemented a framework -- Twitter Watch -- that performs structured Twitter data collection, applying it to the Portuguese Twittersphere. We investigate a data snapshot taken on May 2020, with around 5 million accounts and over 120 million tweets (this value has since increased to over 175 million). The analyzed time period stretches from August 2019 to May 2020, with a focus on the Portuguese elections of October 6th, 2019. However, the Covid-19 pandemic showed itself in our data, and we also delve into how it affected typical Twitter behavior.   We performed three main approaches: content-oriented, metadata-oriented, and network interaction-oriented. We learn that Twitter's suspension patterns are not adequate to the type of political trolling found in the Portuguese Twittersphere -- identified by this work and by an independent peer - nor to fake news posting accounts. We also surmised that the different types of malicious accounts we independently gathered are very similar both in terms of content and interaction, through two distinct analysis, and are simultaneously very distinct from regular accounts.", "preprint": true}, "116218": {"doi": "empty", "journal": "arxiv", "url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.02457v1", "date": "2021-02-04", "title": "Describing, modelling and forecasting the spatial and temporal spread of COVID-19 -- A short review", "subfield": "Healthcare System", "authors": "Julien Arino", "abstract": "SARS-CoV-2 started propagating worldwide in January 2020 and has now reached virtually all communities on the planet.
